00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.640
We don't have a camera set up there,
so we can't show them off.

4be8a2b4-4606-4e24-8142-3df597d2d142-0
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.425

thank you everyone for joining from
across the world.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.360
Now we know a lot of people have dialed
in early in the morning.

79c6b306-30e4-4f52-9539-2b09999e80f0-0
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.360
A lot of people have dialed in late at
night and we appreciate that.

074baa3a-f0db-49db-a81c-bce156cc9604-0
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.148
And we wanted to show that appreciation
by actually bringing some of those people

074baa3a-f0db-49db-a81c-bce156cc9604-1
00:00:47.148 --> 00:00:51.382
from from Permobil who are who are
joining us from this town hall live and

074baa3a-f0db-49db-a81c-bce156cc9604-2

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.920
So let's see if we can get the technology
to work.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.800
This is the moment we hold our 
breath, especially me.

0c1508b2-8544-4c70-80e6-f8767fb67d0b-0
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.320
James, Are you there?

Yeah, we're here.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.280
Hi there.

Where are you?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.400
What's going on there today?

1223003f-30e0-48df-a785-a94d57f491ef-0
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.240
Hey, we're in New Berlin, WI.

695d13fd-2ae5-49d9-86ec-9ea5a6cf3432-0
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.240
We're the home of Comfort and the
greatest cushions in the world.

d58febf4-bea9-462e-b16f-052460f6a05a-0
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.920

Thank you very much.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.760
Love the banners there.

0ced9984-0723-4cc3-af48-1d9842fc1f54-0
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.120
Oh yes, Byron.

7167811a-0ff8-42bf-8855-4ced7204a147-0
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.720
Well, hi everyone.

9e291ba2-4c2b-46b5-8359-19511b0d70c3-0
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.440
I'm so happy to see you all today.

ba1d0bf6-b146-46bf-ae43-3a71d531f03c-0
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.160
I'm Byron from Taiwan,
also from Permobil APAC.

4ffc19d0-d6d6-441d-9c96-bcace417a65e-0
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.040
I look forward to today's time for
meeting to connect and share.

49cd8b6c-cb49-423f-9733-b7e2ca48b6ec-0
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.560
Thank you very much.

b07fb7d3-c11e-425f-8371-364c411f6746-0
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.590
Staying in APAC,
we're now going to have the man who never

b07fb7d3-c11e-425f-8371-364c411f6746-1
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.520
seems to sleep.

75ecc9e6-821b-4328-adbb-16a9e7a0f3a3-0
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.640
Owen, can you hear us?

f8b4f770-c793-4e19-9eb6-5641cb2a26eb-0
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.680
Can you sign in from your Bat cave?

ceafb53c-97db-4797-b725-40b0f6d8416c-0
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.110
Owen,
I am dialing in from the Bat cave here

ceafb53c-97db-4797-b725-40b0f6d8416c-1
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.080
in Australia.

549cb64c-5f75-4178-8299-da20e33e0095-0
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.800
I will see him.

fa7634d6-1d5a-4196-9fe2-1981b2241f41-0
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.720
I'm working for Permobil APAC.

f5e223b7-e102-4e98-8633-5aed6ff23e0d-0
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.224
It's great to see everybody on the call
and I look forward to hearing today's

f5e223b7-e102-4e98-8633-5aed6ff23e0d-1
00:02:06.224 --> 00:02:06.760
meeting.

a1ef3a38-d32f-4995-bbda-b85615b94ec4-0
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.640
Thank you, Owen.

b2cbb3ff-898b-409d-862f-ad9435d9e59e-0
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.880
And now let's jump to Shanghai.

1c10d805-f143-48b5-b052-957d7108bf0a-0
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.440
Who's there?

7df5fd8d-4228-4ec6-83e5-96f5e628fd9f-0
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040
Do you try again, Yishen

f6a9c717-2458-4b09-894d-8431b4e19252-0
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.492
It's funny, after five years since COVID,
we still can't unmute ourselves all the

f6a9c717-2458-4b09-894d-8431b4e19252-1
00:02:23.492 --> 00:02:23.720
time.

fa939ff7-09f7-429a-a7b6-a4f775f6cc3a-0
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.640
But that's OK.

ad718f06-c905-40cc-9694-5273a233dd6d-0
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.040
Give us a wave, Yishen,

15672b3e-f574-4c8e-99f1-3106098d9e2f-0
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.880
Thank you very much.

8d33d841-38cb-4b27-8061-94c5acfc457d-0
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
All right, Yeah, now we've got you.

383aaeb5-7605-454e-bf74-6ec3dc89623a-0
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.636
And then now we're going to jump back to
the Americas,

383aaeb5-7605-454e-bf74-6ec3dc89623a-1
00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:40.480
and we have Jessica and the team in
Lebanon.

687f7106-863f-4ba2-8c9b-77bc2f6fb2b5-0
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.240
I'm sure I've mispronounced that, right?

8d118a1a-908a-4e06-a7ad-50eda973652f-0
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.520
Hey, good morning, Romit.

5baf57b1-43d3-4f0d-9b14-30f69111c0da-0
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.680
Good morning, Jessica.

ab35d6c2-da6d-45fd-a21e-d0c464741914-0
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.880
Good morning, Team Lebanon.

3bb1bd06-f2ef-454f-afad-4eeeb29bcea5-0
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.332
And then last but not least,
we're going to join our team in Treviso,

3bb1bd06-f2ef-454f-afad-4eeeb29bcea5-1
00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:08.680
the home of our Progeo product range.

d7adc35f-2f08-4583-96ff-08e6aeb7affd-0
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.760
Ciao.

4c757701-4251-48aa-ada6-526f73a89ff6-0
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.080
Sharon, Hi.

e85db060-4f49-4a7d-afb1-a6ffaee37554-0
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.840
Can you hear me?

c7e35749-e6cc-4ec2-ac39-ee53bf5ef345-0
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.000
Can you hear me?

7d9c267a-d539-40fe-aaee-fc7df4c45178-0
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.040
OK?

f347ba85-2cc8-45fd-afa8-f31d9daa84d6-0
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.440
Good.

065df26a-022d-414c-875b-617bdbb85999-0
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.280
Hi.

11690bc6-ffe4-4b00-a27a-868bdb6d4c1f-0
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.400
From Treviso.

94333738-a151-4d2d-9a40-2774f3a1c5eb-0
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.080
Let me show you the room here.

4a37d716-34ef-4361-b7c2-becde9c8fd6b-0
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.320
We prepared something for you.

ddb0249c-ff92-460a-a52a-d967ac3ca88f-0
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.520
Hey.

23b002c0-e798-44fa-a487-46ca8b663e5f-0
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.960
And wave something.

571dc65f-5a8e-4125-8cc3-4260a54eeefd-0
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.640
Hey, thank you very much.

142cb5cc-78a9-4bd0-8783-c1bf5009a2bb-0
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.120
Of course.

c9de3093-33fe-451a-8a04-491fdef88d23-0
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.040
Hi Christian, nice to see everyone there.

2785288c-13a5-415c-b1c6-783a730f15aa-0
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.000
Thank you.

869407d9-aff0-493d-9727-6646cdd529ba-0
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.160
So that's just a small sample of our team
around the world.

c22ccbfd-70dd-4859-913f-a52f03c3ac69-0
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.002
Of course,
we know that there are many others who

c22ccbfd-70dd-4859-913f-a52f03c3ac69-1
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.480
are dialing in late, early.

013e4ba9-b23f-4bd7-8f29-a594ad713096-0
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.440
There's even some who are at the middle
of the afternoon just like us.

44db8437-3756-4d39-96b8-b8e72286a6c9-0
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.631
But we will need to give them a shout out
and show off the 

44db8437-3756-4d39-96b8-b8e72286a6c9-1
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:04.640
Permobil family here today.

b66d2595-c64e-4e65-b31b-f5960236e907-0
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.400
So let's get down to to business.

3edd5c0d-f104-4634-966a-59bf082f0883-0
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.252
The first ground rule of today's town
hall,

3edd5c0d-f104-4634-966a-59bf082f0883-1
00:04:10.252 --> 00:04:13.131
which is the same ground rule as every
town hall,

3edd5c0d-f104-4634-966a-59bf082f0883-2
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:17.851
is that this is an internal meeting and
all the information that's shared here is

3edd5c0d-f104-4634-966a-59bf082f0883-3
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:18.600
confidential.

22651240-2949-480b-9e9e-b1f18c794c78-0
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.480
So please don't take any screenshots from
your laptop,

22651240-2949-480b-9e9e-b1f18c794c78-1
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.781
don't take out your phones and take any
photos of what's going on because, yeah,

22651240-2949-480b-9e9e-b1f18c794c78-2
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:28.960
it's confidential.

f7a2f479-4999-45f9-8707-c9e047b16fb2-0
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.080
As I'm sure you can understand.
Our town halls say will be about an hour.

c5398c64-e141-4357-938f-4ee2727f2868-0
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.680
We've got a lot to try and get through.

ce8d592b-77f6-4a7a-8dbd-9bcbc2dc5eec-0
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.420
We're going to be talking about the
strategy, of course,

ce8d592b-77f6-4a7a-8dbd-9bcbc2dc5eec-1
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.797
I'm sure you're all expecting that,
and Chuck will be up in a second to talk

ce8d592b-77f6-4a7a-8dbd-9bcbc2dc5eec-2
00:04:41.797 --> 00:04:42.280
about that.

fa51a6e9-2acd-45b0-9221-aa3fe7d905cc-0
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.080
We're going to deep dive into Innovation
Nodes and about Agile ways of working.

c3869325-2e9e-4926-bd47-2f17584857f0-0
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.912
We're going to have our regional presidents
come up and talk about brand stickiness,

c3869325-2e9e-4926-bd47-2f17584857f0-1
00:04:50.912 --> 00:04:53.240
explaining what that is and how we can
work with that.

88e53ef5-86d1-42da-bf93-5b58239d027b-0
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.778
We're also going to add a little extra
layer of interactivity because we are

88e53ef5-86d1-42da-bf93-5b58239d027b-1
00:04:57.778 --> 00:04:59.960
live and we want to take advantage of
that.

ada9aa45-3a76-4c27-996b-4e4df5029f2c-0
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.600
So we're going to test that out.

b7bfba2b-3756-49d0-bf91-a0e19c5a8de8-0
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.680
We will have some time at the end for
questions and answers.

bcc8bc96-219f-4ed0-8c77-e15976998da2-0
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.400
So we'll do all the Q&amp;
A at the end. To submit your questions,

c34449b4-d5c8-4e6c-87e8-3875d1844d71-0
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.960
we're going to use a platform called
Mentimmeter.

2f5d465d-7a41-443f-9884-2c7cb344053d-0
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.262
So if you're here in the room,
you can you can come in either using the

2f5d465d-7a41-443f-9884-2c7cb344053d-1
00:05:15.262 --> 00:05:17.160
QR code, and people at home as well,

8f59a044-702e-4d0d-b111-c7e7b8b85ac4-0
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.520
You can use the QR code or you can use
that URL at the top and the login code.

9f931f88-0800-4dd3-aa1c-7225b36d8922-0
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.330
You can submit your questions at any
point you're in the town hall,

9f931f88-0800-4dd3-aa1c-7225b36d8922-1
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.520
but we'll take them at the end.

1915955e-b296-4a06-9145-78408d78bb91-0
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.640
We're going to show this QR code again a
bit later on in case you need it.

f10e6b5d-6811-4efc-8223-64cbe8f5fc2b-0
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.160
The questions will be anonymous.

5e002e19-c086-42ce-b974-2ba1cb953b41-0
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.891
If you want to add your name and where
you are, that would be great,

5e002e19-c086-42ce-b974-2ba1cb953b41-1
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:36.040
but there's no need for that.

3a2d3e1b-3c84-405c-9921-fac1443bbe99-0
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.960
And then with that.

16f83d16-5dcd-4c4a-997c-007d803fddf1-0
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.320
I hand over to Chuck to talk about the
strategy.

722157db-2253-4b67-8cfb-4518f2ca1ea0-0
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.720
I like it.

1058932c-6b93-4842-b9c2-1d350497e9f0-0
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.160
I like it.

da1ac0ac-7ad1-4dd8-bef7-d090f73d0812-0
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.960
A little less talk, a little more action.

4806bae3-eace-41d8-8a9f-de6999c26103-0
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.000
I heard that might have been a joke
around here a couple years ago.

252ca684-572c-4295-9ee2-670d1a4796de-0
00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.320
Yeah.

f6a3153c-cf7e-4c3e-82de-728d3ddfa1d8-0
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.320
So we're going to lean into that.

7a6c2e36-96ab-4201-8fae-b1fdde5d1354-0
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.960
Yeah.

695687a3-a4e6-4baf-8fab-ab69168032cc-0
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.495
First of all,
great to see all of our colleagues around

695687a3-a4e6-4baf-8fab-ab69168032cc-1
00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:05.920
the world.

7707896f-c2a0-4f3a-bb67-4034a65666dc-0
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920
That was really cool.

ffe53b83-1f27-4ee3-aee6-0b55c1227e89-0
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.100
Not all of our colleagues,
but some of our colleagues around the

ffe53b83-1f27-4ee3-aee6-0b55c1227e89-1
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.320
world.

0d120737-e394-4199-bda5-2c69774f65e5-0
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.805
And thanks everyone for joining,
especially those that are up super early

0d120737-e394-4199-bda5-2c69774f65e5-1
00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:17.400
or Owen up super late.

db81a473-d552-401e-bbbf-abc70a155d13-0
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.480
Really appreciate it.

eb00a266-72be-4290-a582-71009822d4ce-0
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.560
And then it is great to be here
broadcasting from Sundsvall.

60ac073f-afc7-46bb-815d-bed52e36d117-0
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.550
And the choice to roll out our strategy
formally here in Sundsvall was very

60ac073f-afc7-46bb-815d-bed52e36d117-1
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.960
purposeful and symbolic.

bb61f520-8b88-4748-9926-f1e240cd11f6-0
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.500
Because of course,
this is the area that is our birthplace

bb61f520-8b88-4748-9926-f1e240cd11f6-1
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.600
right as a company where Per founded the
company in '67, right?

96aa514c-ac12-48cb-9298-517395c08856-0
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.789
With a purpose,
which was to allow all individuals,

96aa514c-ac12-48cb-9298-517395c08856-1
00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:53.428
irrespective of their abilities to get
out and explore the world with

96aa514c-ac12-48cb-9298-517395c08856-2
00:06:53.428 --> 00:06:55.040
independence, right?

e4148049-5fd6-4897-bfb0-6b6b3601b645-0
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.590
And I think that what you'll see is that
with our go forward strategy refresh,

e4148049-5fd6-4897-bfb0-6b6b3601b645-1
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.544
we are very much getting back to and
we'll be focusing a lot on our heritage,

e4148049-5fd6-4897-bfb0-6b6b3601b645-2
00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:14.422
which is a obsession over our end users
and serving them through innovation,

e4148049-5fd6-4897-bfb0-6b6b3601b645-3
00:07:14.422 --> 00:07:14.880
right?

e5530d9e-3863-4507-b6b6-752176651f4c-0
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.720
This is our founding.

cf2e1e4d-f87a-440d-ba0c-7897229058ab-0
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.360
So very purposeful for us to be doing
this here from Sundsvall today.

6c4064ad-9e17-44c8-ade7-ec765df618d5-0
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.440
And I want to start by telling you the
time is now.

154d59e5-41a0-4f58-80cd-8fc7a219924c-0
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.520
What do I mean by that?

fea48129-eb9d-4a3d-b053-9adbb8f2e6ac-0
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.440
The time is now.

393ac07e-ecd1-4c11-a93f-caaab7f4d86a-0
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.659
There has not been a more exciting time,
I would argue,

393ac07e-ecd1-4c11-a93f-caaab7f4d86a-1
00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:38.160
in human history to be in our industry,
the assistive mobility industry.

da5ed078-eb46-416c-a584-4458ecd67c22-0
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.680
And why do I say that?

c51b0487-ddf5-45da-b953-3c258c856b87-0
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.742
Number one,
we have a tremendous increase in the

c51b0487-ddf5-45da-b953-3c258c856b87-1
00:07:43.742 --> 00:07:49.164
number of individuals who require
assistive mobility equipment and that is

c51b0487-ddf5-45da-b953-3c258c856b87-2
00:07:49.164 --> 00:07:51.840
fueled by an aging population, right?

95386de9-d485-4ca3-9cf6-d2227215481a-0
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.375
And also an increasing number of chronic
conditions and all of that is driving

95386de9-d485-4ca3-9cf6-d2227215481a-1
00:07:57.375 --> 00:08:02.435
actually tremendous growth in the number
of individuals who require the kinds of

95386de9-d485-4ca3-9cf6-d2227215481a-2
00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:03.560
things that we do.

ee950d22-011f-4958-b473-f82fb0b10402-0
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.920
Super exciting.

e9c3fd84-a138-45bf-a0e8-4f44ffabc089-0
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.241
Equally exciting for me,
because I'm kind of a nerd anyways,

e9c3fd84-a138-45bf-a0e8-4f44ffabc089-1
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:15.646
I like to pretend I'm a tech nerd,
is the technology that's developing right

e9c3fd84-a138-45bf-a0e8-4f44ffabc089-2
00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:17.120
now around the world.

ac41b696-f2e3-42b6-b585-c988e2f7ea13-0
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.465
If you're watching what is happening in
robotics right now,

ac41b696-f2e3-42b6-b585-c988e2f7ea13-1
00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:27.114
which are essentially right actuator
driven machines with electronics kind of

ac41b696-f2e3-42b6-b585-c988e2f7ea13-2
00:08:27.114 --> 00:08:32.256
like what we do in many cases,
it's incredible what's happening in the

ac41b696-f2e3-42b6-b585-c988e2f7ea13-3
00:08:32.256 --> 00:08:33.559
field of robotics.

e0e78637-2dbf-44ae-9e3b-c4af29ae75aa-0
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.880
It's incredible what's happening right
now in the area of computer brain

e0e78637-2dbf-44ae-9e3b-c4af29ae75aa-1
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.232
interface,
whether that's implantables or non

e0e78637-2dbf-44ae-9e3b-c4af29ae75aa-2
00:08:42.232 --> 00:08:47.989
implantables that can actually read our
brain waves and translate our thoughts

e0e78637-2dbf-44ae-9e3b-c4af29ae75aa-3
00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:49.520
into physical action.

d2ebf89b-901c-4ade-b171-836e6c3587ce-0
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.760
Think about that.

b771d05d-ebc2-47ce-92a2-3ce491d74563-0
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.410
And then also coming in from the side,
right is what's happening with AI right

b771d05d-ebc2-47ce-92a2-3ce491d74563-1
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:56.640
now.

54063494-7b57-4449-b963-99e40b52f001-0
00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.271
And so I would say, right,
the technology that's occurring,

54063494-7b57-4449-b963-99e40b52f001-1
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:04.349
the market growth that's that is
occurring in terms of the number and of

54063494-7b57-4449-b963-99e40b52f001-2
00:09:04.349 --> 00:09:06.360
individuals that need our solutions.

c608e3e0-2b6c-4421-811c-0894a6fe53a5-0
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.639
There could not be a more exciting time
in all of human history to be an

c608e3e0-2b6c-4421-811c-0894a6fe53a5-1
00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:12.920
assistive mobility.

024492de-4f19-4c14-ba1a-1a6b1854289e-0
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.040
At least that's how I feel.

9b375407-312e-4366-b7a5-352bd4d610f2-0
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.627
And at the same time,
we have to change with an extreme sense

9b375407-312e-4366-b7a5-352bd4d610f2-1
00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:26.480
of urgency or we will become a dinosaur,
right?

0a88a080-a080-4e7b-a38c-4e25a8cfbcd1-0
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.440
On one hand,
we have tremendous downward cost pressure.

58326013-9ada-43a1-b647-9c0aaa9e38b0-0
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.807
So the same trends that are driving the
number of individuals that need our

58326013-9ada-43a1-b647-9c0aaa9e38b0-1
00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:37.394
equipment, aging population,
new technology,

58326013-9ada-43a1-b647-9c0aaa9e38b0-2
00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:41.244
increasing chronic conditions,
those trends are putting tremendous

58326013-9ada-43a1-b647-9c0aaa9e38b0-3
00:09:41.244 --> 00:09:45.440
downward pricing pressure on healthcare
systems around the world, right?

991a29bf-9433-4169-99a2-e451c34f5e73-0
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.537
And so that's a lot of downward pricing
pressure in many of the markets that we

991a29bf-9433-4169-99a2-e451c34f5e73-1
00:09:50.537 --> 00:09:50.920
serve.

d09a9fda-487f-4a15-96f5-48d7e68111f9-0
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.392
We have a layer,
a dealer layer that separates us as a

d09a9fda-487f-4a15-96f5-48d7e68111f9-1
00:09:55.392 --> 00:10:00.760
manufacturer from the end users and the
payers that we work with.

bbc927bd-1faa-4e50-ad88-7edabb17cfcc-0
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.480
And those dealers are consolidating,
right?

6ca9c5b8-3393-470d-b752-f521fd97a4e5-0
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.224
And as they get bigger and stronger,
they're consolidating their purchasing

6ca9c5b8-3393-470d-b752-f521fd97a4e5-1
00:10:07.224 --> 00:10:07.520
power.

3ec0f896-4342-40f6-b2dc-81e736bf1fa0-0
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400
And So what does that mean?

3442a41c-fd21-4469-9b41-33d5b4b4ecca-0
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.120
They're putting the pressure on us all
the time to deliver lower cost.

c0252053-9f3e-4289-889e-e5074de67ea9-0
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.280
These are big challenges for us, right?

877ec5ee-77ad-4f46-86cc-47aa6107ee39-0
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.717
And if we don't adapt,
if we continue to sell the world's most

877ec5ee-77ad-4f46-86cc-47aa6107ee39-1
00:10:20.717 --> 00:10:24.240
expensive products, it's going to be hard,
right?

5214ddcf-e7ac-43ed-b13a-e6d0a1e5c337-0
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.144
And then we have competition,
existing competition that quite frankly

5214ddcf-e7ac-43ed-b13a-e6d0a1e5c337-1
00:10:30.144 --> 00:10:33.601
in many cases, not all,
but in some cases anyways,

5214ddcf-e7ac-43ed-b13a-e6d0a1e5c337-2
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:37.600
has been out innovating us over the last
few years, right?

74f6531d-aa4d-41cc-a7d5-2f3266f0ede2-0
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.753
And these are existing competitors
bringing more products to market faster

74f6531d-aa4d-41cc-a7d5-2f3266f0ede2-1
00:10:42.753 --> 00:10:45.309
than we have,
but they're not the ones that I'm

74f6531d-aa4d-41cc-a7d5-2f3266f0ede2-2
00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:47.120
actually the most concerned about.

6910d50e-d296-4f2f-9660-b88cb159b95b-0
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:54.047
I'm concerned about a new breed of
competitor, A robotics FIRST competitor,

6910d50e-d296-4f2f-9660-b88cb159b95b-1
00:10:54.047 --> 00:11:01.044
largely from Asia that is hyper fast,
super low cost and coming at our industry

6910d50e-d296-4f2f-9660-b88cb159b95b-2
00:11:01.044 --> 00:11:05.680
from the side, right,
in a completely different way.

485994aa-a282-4d73-aeb3-c3be394cdd3c-0
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.796
And again, if we don't adapt,
and I think this is true frankly,

485994aa-a282-4d73-aeb3-c3be394cdd3c-1
00:11:09.796 --> 00:11:13.720
for many industries,
if not all industries around the world,

485994aa-a282-4d73-aeb3-c3be394cdd3c-2
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.094
if we don't adapt and change,
we could go the way of the dinosaurs,

485994aa-a282-4d73-aeb3-c3be394cdd3c-3
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:18.479
right?

8bc63505-3c56-4e3e-94e9-55cd4e52d0d1-0
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.040
So it was the best of times and it was
the worst of times, right?

7b2ee9a0-0a5c-49c8-817f-228417fce205-0
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:29.187
A tremendous opportunity for us here to
to move into the future and not only

7b2ee9a0-0a5c-49c8-817f-228417fce205-1
00:11:29.187 --> 00:11:35.096
create a world that is that leverages
this new technology to not only aid

7b2ee9a0-0a5c-49c8-817f-228417fce205-2
00:11:35.096 --> 00:11:41.483
individuals with mobility impairments,
but potentially eliminate those mobility

7b2ee9a0-0a5c-49c8-817f-228417fce205-3
00:11:41.483 --> 00:11:43.480
limitations all together.

64c9b20e-23b6-4c26-a64f-9c19e31c01fd-0
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.880
But we've got to adapt because the
competition is coming strong, right?

f7803da9-645f-46bb-83c2-048c86c88a2f-0
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.240
So how do we do it?

5f626883-96c5-4308-b29c-343392af6201-0
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.528
So as you've heard me kind of drop these
little nuggets and bombs,

5f626883-96c5-4308-b29c-343392af6201-1
00:11:54.528 --> 00:11:59.121
maybe on Viva Engage,
we have a new strategy that I think I

5f626883-96c5-4308-b29c-343392af6201-2
00:11:59.121 --> 00:12:04.480
hope you'll find is actually quite simple,
simple to say, hard to do.

c1e249c0-3f82-41d3-9046-e99fca60fb27-0
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.793
So hopefully we can remember it and it
consists of three strategic imperatives

c1e249c0-3f82-41d3-9046-e99fca60fb27-1
00:12:09.793 --> 00:12:11.240
and they're pretty simple.

7d159b62-ab25-4815-a5ab-0c7e341b7585-0
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.800
Number one,
increase our Pace of Innovation.

6a77a070-96ae-4f8e-8240-99d2ad9eab01-0
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.080
What do I mean by that?

22e590a3-343c-4973-ba51-74bc603ff195-0
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.080
What do we mean by that?

b96dc65a-2e83-47a3-b658-e165374144aa-0
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:22.624
We mean we want to cut the time from
concept to launch in half, right,

b96dc65a-2e83-47a3-b658-e165374144aa-1
00:12:22.624 --> 00:12:25.280
increasing our pace of innovation.

a5b9a4a2-da7b-4505-8a59-492cfb73e584-0
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.641
At the same time,
these are not just big platform launches,

a5b9a4a2-da7b-4505-8a59-492cfb73e584-1
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:36.894
but we need to continuously release
features and new functionality through

a5b9a4a2-da7b-4505-8a59-492cfb73e584-2
00:12:36.894 --> 00:12:43.229
what we would call more minor launches
with a target of 4 to 8 per year per

a5b9a4a2-da7b-4505-8a59-492cfb73e584-3
00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:48.981
platform to think of it very much like
software and then step change

a5b9a4a2-da7b-4505-8a59-492cfb73e584-4
00:12:48.981 --> 00:12:53.400
improvements in our platforms every 18
months or so.

846734ad-513d-44ee-840b-3dec8b05787b-0
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.818
It's a big change, right,
and a big challenge and we'll talk a

846734ad-513d-44ee-840b-3dec8b05787b-1
00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.760
little bit about how we think we can do
that.

f73d499c-498b-4a81-a809-cac2820097c9-0
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.720
Number 2, implement Extreme Manufacturing.

468320af-7a37-4d5b-8df5-7f67021d2bd9-0
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.130
And what this is,
is really standardizing and investing in

468320af-7a37-4d5b-8df5-7f67021d2bd9-1
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:12.970
our manufacturing processes in a way that
we have not done in a long time so that

468320af-7a37-4d5b-8df5-7f67021d2bd9-2
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:18.596
we can both support this rapid pace of
innovation and significantly drive down

468320af-7a37-4d5b-8df5-7f67021d2bd9-3
00:13:18.596 --> 00:13:24.079
our product cost in response to the macro
trends that I talked about, right?

6f831d3c-b349-419a-b739-706a7809bf51-0
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:31.000
And so here we're targeting a 35 to 45%
decrease in product cost and that cannot

6f831d3c-b349-419a-b739-706a7809bf51-1
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.480
come at the expense of quality or
functionality, right?

c062c661-a5e0-4201-b393-0c29b57fbfb0-0
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.059
So it's really challenging. Number 3
simple to say,

c062c661-a5e0-4201-b393-0c29b57fbfb0-1
00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:45.360
hard to do again is to create Brand
Stickiness.

2bbffa2a-57bc-4501-8685-06c97b87262e-0
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.316
So outside of our products,
how do we establish Permobil, and all of

2bbffa2a-57bc-4501-8685-06c97b87262e-1
00:13:51.316 --> 00:13:57.868
our brands, as the most desired brands in
the world in the space of assistive

2bbffa2a-57bc-4501-8685-06c97b87262e-2
00:13:57.868 --> 00:14:04.676
mobility and create that user loyalty
that transcends the industry dynamics and

2bbffa2a-57bc-4501-8685-06c97b87262e-3
00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:08.079
the pricing pressure that we get, right.

9b667f46-bc32-4235-b161-8138c1cac1b6-0
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.300
So that we have users that frankly are
demanding our products irrespective of

9b667f46-bc32-4235-b161-8138c1cac1b6-1
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:13.880
the cost.

6e80b13c-91ce-49c7-8bc3-c1266a74b177-0
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:22.010
That's what brand stickiness is right now
To enable these three strategic

6e80b13c-91ce-49c7-8bc3-c1266a74b177-1
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.200
imperatives.

7b71b703-941f-4f1d-b0b7-96fef64fcd4b-0
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.840
We have what we call our twin
accelerators.

80aa1668-ffcd-48b4-90db-a11694a6da7f-0
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.864
And I will argue that the most important
thing is actually the one in the upper

80aa1668-ffcd-48b4-90db-a11694a6da7f-1
00:14:30.864 --> 00:14:33.454
right,
and that's our Culture and the culture

80aa1668-ffcd-48b4-90db-a11694a6da7f-2
00:14:33.454 --> 00:14:36.720
change that we need to drive in order to
accomplish this.

d9e7e9ff-a9c4-4b90-a005-9bb5fd901575-0
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.431
We're going to have to dramatically shift
our way of thinking and acting in our

d9e7e9ff-a9c4-4b90-a005-9bb5fd901575-1
00:14:43.431 --> 00:14:44.360
organization.

a0477fbf-d822-42a9-b6ee-6d26785400ea-0
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.720
And that's from the boardroom to the
factory floor, all of us, right?

8c228453-eaa6-4e76-a74c-882693cbeff8-0
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.587
And I'll talk a bit more about what I
mean by that,

8c228453-eaa6-4e76-a74c-882693cbeff8-1
00:14:51.587 --> 00:14:54.720
but it's a major culture change that we
all have to be a part of.

68a3fb2d-421c-4a5f-b4ab-dce9f131ce84-0
00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:01.508
And then the fifth one,
which some might argue Charlotta is the

68a3fb2d-421c-4a5f-b4ab-dce9f131ce84-1
00:15:01.508 --> 00:15:03.280
most exciting is AI.

be4c4f6b-da91-4ba7-b87b-d59c9d54e4b2-0
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:09.982
And we are leaning all the way in to AI
and we will build our own AI core as part

be4c4f6b-da91-4ba7-b87b-d59c9d54e4b2-1
00:15:09.982 --> 00:15:13.640
of the strategy over the next 18 to 24
months.

5b2a7b55-3350-4ace-8bcf-5a8e691af8c7-0
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:21.086
That will help us capture and translate
market insights into innovation,

5b2a7b55-3350-4ace-8bcf-5a8e691af8c7-1
00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:28.687
will help us drive quality manufacturing
efficiency and commercial effectiveness,

5b2a7b55-3350-4ace-8bcf-5a8e691af8c7-2
00:15:28.687 --> 00:15:35.546
and ultimately help us orchestrate our
decentralized global organization,

5b2a7b55-3350-4ace-8bcf-5a8e691af8c7-3
00:15:35.546 --> 00:15:37.400
our AI mother brain.

3ece2ada-78ff-4510-a0fd-1a5e16fbbca8-0
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.040
So these are the five elements,
if you will, to our new strategy.

ecaf75bf-002e-4c18-b9ae-3c4b463bc4d4-0
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.146
We will not accomplish all of this next
month as much as I may push or next year,

ecaf75bf-002e-4c18-b9ae-3c4b463bc4d4-1
00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:47.520
right?

e41d1a8d-0641-48a1-85fe-70d795afcff8-0
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.552
This is a blueprint for a multi year
strategy,

e41d1a8d-0641-48a1-85fe-70d795afcff8-1
00:15:51.552 --> 00:15:58.329
a strategic vision for us to solidify our
place in the future as the leader of

e41d1a8d-0641-48a1-85fe-70d795afcff8-2
00:15:58.329 --> 00:15:59.960
assistive mobility.

b47dd6c5-fe9f-45f6-a015-14c6818d2ff6-0
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.089
So let me take one layer off of each of
these and I'll try to do it pretty

b47dd6c5-fe9f-45f6-a015-14c6818d2ff6-1
00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:08.381
quickly here,
switching over to accelerate our pace of

b47dd6c5-fe9f-45f6-a015-14c6818d2ff6-2
00:16:08.381 --> 00:16:09.040
innovation.

902b9735-147e-4325-b0bc-2e55e6ee0a9a-0
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.882
And if I just focus your attention,
you can't see my pointer to the kind of

902b9735-147e-4325-b0bc-2e55e6ee0a9a-1
00:16:13.882 --> 00:16:17.320
the four middle boxes there,
what we call the pivotal enablers.

dcc58c39-08f6-4037-a535-e0def7ad57a0-0
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.400
What are the key enablers of bringing
this to life?

984109f2-8679-45f5-bfb4-b203089b8fb5-0
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.172
Number one,
it is creating cross functional teams

984109f2-8679-45f5-bfb4-b203089b8fb5-1
00:16:25.172 --> 00:16:30.229
with clear ownership,
global cross functional teams with clear

984109f2-8679-45f5-bfb4-b203089b8fb5-2
00:16:30.229 --> 00:16:33.600
ownership around our product areas, right?

5aab7035-cb42-4f6b-a3d8-224a5ffe78a9-0
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.056
You've heard me refer to these maybe as
Innovation Nodes because I think of,

5aab7035-cb42-4f6b-a3d8-224a5ffe78a9-1
00:16:38.056 --> 00:16:41.240
I think of us a little bit like a,
an organism, right?

6571fce5-2945-42de-b64e-5b735e5ddc8d-0
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.960
And we have nodes that are all connected.

d0d8aa72-2892-449e-9ec0-79983def518a-0
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.367
These are highly autonomous,
empowered innovation units without a lot,

d0d8aa72-2892-449e-9ec0-79983def518a-1
00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:53.894
and we've been talking about it this week,
without a lot of governance and need for

d0d8aa72-2892-449e-9ec0-79983def518a-2
00:16:53.894 --> 00:16:54.560
reporting.

b3ef60ef-599e-4529-aed3-0988427b68b6-0
00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.007
We want to cut through the bureaucracy in
the red tape to make decisions and drive

b3ef60ef-599e-4529-aed3-0988427b68b6-1
00:17:00.007 --> 00:17:01.840
innovation with speed and impact.

540797c4-224e-4ac4-b611-9220884c652a-0
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.920
Number 2 is implementing Agile ways of
working.

094d6747-9115-437e-bd4b-2ba3eeaf8e99-0
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.200
Now what does this mean to me?

c0a01d20-deda-41f3-98a3-a80219a5b975-0
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.632
For me, agile,
I don't care about the theory or the

c0a01d20-deda-41f3-98a3-a80219a5b975-1
00:17:14.632 --> 00:17:15.480
terminology.

aa9d7696-1cad-425b-9a21-23d3fb66078f-0
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.782
What Agile is to me is that we disregard
the need for long range plans that try to

aa9d7696-1cad-425b-9a21-23d3fb66078f-1
00:17:22.782 --> 00:17:27.961
predict every step that's necessary in a
product development effort and then

aa9d7696-1cad-425b-9a21-23d3fb66078f-2
00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:32.400
predict where we're going to be in 18 to
24 months with accuracy.

07fdb9a4-4416-42a3-87d2-82caa8c9284f-0
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:39.520
But rather we focus on how do we drive
velocity in short incremental sprints.

29a8c09a-9bde-453d-800e-ee0c4d6f554a-0
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.633
And what we know is that if we do this
and we do it really quickly,

29a8c09a-9bde-453d-800e-ee0c4d6f554a-1
00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:48.920
we will learn things in these sprints
that help us take the next sprint.

e2ad4b53-69b8-43bb-b004-6a1d40c8d239-0
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.440
And it gets back to this idea of pace of
change.

0d7e2b11-63c8-4acd-aa7f-9e37407a5e7c-0
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.638
The faster we drive these sprints,
the faster we learn,

0d7e2b11-63c8-4acd-aa7f-9e37407a5e7c-1
00:17:56.638 --> 00:17:57.880
the faster we iterate.

b2969d9c-b51b-4b97-a2b0-442cfebac9a0-0
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:04.976
And this is how we can both accelerate
our pace of innovation for large

b2969d9c-b51b-4b97-a2b0-442cfebac9a0-1
00:18:04.976 --> 00:18:07.000
platforms, but also drive

bca4a4e0-a6e2-40f7-9167-272417cb64a0-0
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.760
continuous product releases.

54a363f4-180d-49fa-82ad-ceb1c368ac82-0
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.815
And Catharina is going to talk more about
this here in a little bit #3 we need a

54a363f4-180d-49fa-82ad-ceb1c368ac82-1
00:18:14.815 --> 00:18:18.285
system,
a global quality management system that

54a363f4-180d-49fa-82ad-ceb1c368ac82-2
00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:20.960
works with us, not against us, right?

c100b55d-a7c3-4067-97a9-4d951d97d0ef-0
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.269
And so here we will digitalize,
standardize and streamline our QMS to

c100b55d-a7c3-4067-97a9-4d951d97d0ef-1
00:18:27.269 --> 00:18:32.160
support our innovation,
commercial and manufacturing processes.

33ede680-b04c-4c05-b37a-7aacb0072461-0
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.824
This is actually already far underway,
and I think we'll be here sooner than we

33ede680-b04c-4c05-b37a-7aacb0072461-1
00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.120
might than we might think.

a0177332-7531-49f9-aecd-abf3cb746844-0
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.760
And then the fourth piece is strategic
partnerships and M&amp;A.

233f5f77-61fe-471e-9bf4-78eb511466dc-0
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.978
And over the last 10 years or so, right,
we have really focused our M&amp;A

233f5f77-61fe-471e-9bf4-78eb511466dc-1
00:18:47.978 --> 00:18:50.320
efforts on expanding our 
product portfolio.

fce7bc75-e44a-4dc2-a352-0701a6f5b74c-0
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.600
And of course, we may continue to do that.

2e230df5-72c2-453b-ada2-62bb3e006145-0
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.608
But here we also seek to bring in new
technology,

2e230df5-72c2-453b-ada2-62bb3e006145-1
00:18:56.608 --> 00:19:01.320
new competence and new capacity through
partnerships and M&amp;A.

16277249-efc7-4b23-95cb-297df663a0de-0
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:09.920
So these are the four key enablers for
accelerating our pace of innovation.

0353a424-1177-41c4-9982-f5178e5c93bb-0
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.600
And you can see the KPIs that we 
see there on the right.

7b06342b-cabc-4102-8fff-3efb50d7467a-0
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.492
If I switch over quickly to implementing
extreme manufacturing here,

7b06342b-cabc-4102-8fff-3efb50d7467a-1
00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:24.441
the three key enablers here 1 is a lot
around our supply chain and thinking

7b06342b-cabc-4102-8fff-3efb50d7467a-2
00:19:24.441 --> 00:19:26.720
differently about our supply chain.

cb823d34-a940-450d-9451-52dcd254e8c1-0
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:32.858
And this is moving from a mindset of
really striving for the lowest cost part

cb823d34-a940-450d-9451-52dcd254e8c1-1
00:19:32.858 --> 00:19:38.918
at day one at launch and focusing on how
do we construct our supply chain to

cb823d34-a940-450d-9451-52dcd254e8c1-2
00:19:38.918 --> 00:19:41.280
enable our pace of innovation.

30cf3252-016d-4aa3-8b63-9a1a8ac3813b-0
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:47.474
And that likely means working with more
geographically close suppliers and also

30cf3252-016d-4aa3-8b63-9a1a8ac3813b-1
00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:51.331
in key areas,
actually bringing that manufacturing in

30cf3252-016d-4aa3-8b63-9a1a8ac3813b-2
00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:51.760
house.

a099868d-4863-4774-8e9e-030f72bd23e2-0
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:57.680
So we can work in an iterative fashion
with our innovation teams, right?

c4e0c1b5-939d-495f-9232-14e8e9bbe84e-0
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.960
It doesn't mean we won't strive for
product cost.

1a5e3545-85b0-470e-b756-0044e539ebd5-0
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.219
Of course we will,
but we'll take those in the after launch

1a5e3545-85b0-470e-b756-0044e539ebd5-1
00:20:04.219 --> 00:20:05.360
sprint cycles, right?

dd1d7a6c-1b16-4ed9-9131-68c5556ebf81-0
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.081
And we'll continuously work to to
simplify our components and streamline

dd1d7a6c-1b16-4ed9-9131-68c5556ebf81-1
00:20:10.081 --> 00:20:11.440
our processes and drive

129503ed-9fb0-4700-be25-30af5a76f25d-0
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.160
our costs down.

04da5caf-5cc8-432b-8b4c-3537058cf071-0
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.688
Digitalization,
we are highly fragmented today across our

04da5caf-5cc8-432b-8b4c-3537058cf071-1
00:20:18.688 --> 00:20:23.993
manufacturing units and that presents a
lot of challenges to us: master data

04da5caf-5cc8-432b-8b4c-3537058cf071-2
00:20:23.993 --> 00:20:25.320
through to ERP systems.

6cb57f35-3869-477b-817e-e4a67159d3e8-0
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:31.695
So here we will streamline and digitalize
our processes on one global platform,

6cb57f35-3869-477b-817e-e4a67159d3e8-1
00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:35.600
which will then feed our AI core moving
forward.

054d7215-0304-477d-9a05-9b5dcc88dddc-0
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.080
Just that one is a huge,
huge initiative in and of itself.

3ef2fd91-430b-459e-86db-22b106af9f8d-0
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.120
And then last but not least,
modular automation.

103d36e0-0ff6-4a0c-96ef-ab37dcec6912-0
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:50.631
So here we will focus on automating those
repetitive, and frankly tasks that's that

103d36e0-0ff6-4a0c-96ef-ab37dcec6912-1
00:20:50.631 --> 00:20:56.201
maybe present even safety risk, so that we
can both improve our output,

103d36e0-0ff6-4a0c-96ef-ab37dcec6912-2
00:20:56.201 --> 00:21:02.320
improve our employee morale and improve
the quality of what we're developing.

d48e3426-6717-4fae-a1ab-69484f3c69ff-0
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.120
And we'll do this in a modular way.

e520393b-ad05-466d-8fe2-acd15ab65553-0
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.704
And these are robotic systems that we can
use for multiple tasks and move those

e520393b-ad05-466d-8fe2-acd15ab65553-1
00:21:08.704 --> 00:21:10.080
around with flexibility.

2a2bea79-f753-47c4-9796-97003d1090bc-0
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:17.800
The three key enablers of extreme
manufacturing, creating brand stickiness.

22667b23-06e0-4b47-8918-67929baa4c55-0
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:25.960
So here we continue to focus on localized
commercial operations.

b7d763ff-bd35-4271-8ae5-7e6efea2ff3d-0
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.005
What we know is actually the number one
way to create brand stickiness is to be

b7d763ff-bd35-4271-8ae5-7e6efea2ff3d-1
00:21:31.005 --> 00:21:35.000
locally relevant and highly responsive in
the markets that we serve, right?

9ff51b94-13f2-4297-8db5-f6669d99044b-0
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.520
We've got to be there.

25dca765-9454-4987-ae41-c42a6eb430fa-0
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.000
We've got to speak their language right,
our our dealers and our end users.

dfca6468-1c25-42f9-81f7-ab70d523816e-0
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.760
And that requires a a hyper localized
approach.

39d09f9d-28ed-49a5-b0cb-257a76e6f574-0
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.640
So we'll continue the focus there.

2033a423-55ff-46fa-a2ed-a119c2685029-0
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.160
One Permobil customer experience,
I think you've probably heard a lot about.

dd590de7-c44a-420f-8616-db1fb4e1b290-0
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.760
I'll just touch on a brief briefly.

d5db06ec-bef0-4dba-8656-a59417eaa2dc-0
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.495
It's basically how do we take the broad
assortment,

d5db06ec-bef0-4dba-8656-a59417eaa2dc-1
00:21:56.495 --> 00:22:02.099
product assortment that we have today,
cushions and backs and chassis and and

d5db06ec-bef0-4dba-8656-a59417eaa2dc-2
00:22:02.099 --> 00:22:07.631
instead of asking our customers to treat
us as multiple different companies,

d5db06ec-bef0-4dba-8656-a59417eaa2dc-3
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:12.948
we actually bring that together through
the per mobile store and we allow

d5db06ec-bef0-4dba-8656-a59417eaa2dc-4
00:22:12.948 --> 00:22:18.480
solutions to be ordered, delivered,
invoiced as a solution to our end users.

f2eeb987-e752-4662-a510-0c73016c952e-0
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.360
This really leverages the portfolio that
we've built over the last decade.

34d7456e-12f1-4303-91c5-1bfe336ae5ea-0
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.423
And our aim here is again to be the
easiest to do business with supplier in

34d7456e-12f1-4303-91c5-1bfe336ae5ea-1
00:22:28.423 --> 00:22:29.000
the world.

464d7e9f-cf59-44c8-a64b-552191e83b19-0
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.366
And we know when we do that,
our dealers even though we might be a

464d7e9f-cf59-44c8-a64b-552191e83b19-1
00:22:32.366 --> 00:22:35.186
little more expensive,
they're going to want to work with us,

464d7e9f-cf59-44c8-a64b-552191e83b19-2
00:22:35.186 --> 00:22:36.960
right, because we make their life easy.

8e6f2c87-1213-4b18-b88a-bb626fe084cd-0
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.960
We also reduce errors on their part.

838bd7f9-ebef-4ca3-b586-89828e6613e0-0
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.880
And then the last piece here is end user
engagement amplification.

15d22998-105d-4fc5-919c-77a028acc518-0
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.777
And here again,
what we're talking about is working both

15d22998-105d-4fc5-919c-77a028acc518-1
00:22:51.777 --> 00:22:58.339
digitally and physically to really engage
with our installed base through social

15d22998-105d-4fc5-919c-77a028acc518-2
00:22:58.339 --> 00:23:03.200
media, right through communities,
through community events.

49b87a9a-51f4-4134-a683-94053a21ec9e-0
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.541
There's one actually happening this
weekend or next weekend in Nashville

49b87a9a-51f4-4134-a683-94053a21ec9e-1
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:09.920
where we're bringing end users together.

d6fda73c-da81-4136-a124-2cd594d08493-0
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:16.091
And it's how do we unleash the power of
our installed base, right,

d6fda73c-da81-4136-a124-2cd594d08493-1
00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:18.960
to advocate for Permobil products.

84dc0a23-e95c-4cbb-a13c-dfac5b7bd0d6-0
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.040
It's very much a direct to consumer kind
of marketing approach, right?

628928a3-cafe-4acd-b82d-1f2af3adee29-0
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.920
So these are the three pieces here.

2fb4c0f1-d4c1-458b-9b08-967963d899a0-0
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.015
As I mentioned,
we have our twin accelerators which will

2fb4c0f1-d4c1-458b-9b08-967963d899a0-1
00:23:29.015 --> 00:23:30.480
help us unlock these.

2ce03ef6-8d3d-48e9-b04a-ad09873060e6-0
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.915
And I want to touch quickly on culture,
evolved culture paradigm,

2ce03ef6-8d3d-48e9-b04a-ad09873060e6-1
00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:39.120
implementation of a true learning culture.

6acf6b1b-0c20-4449-a864-35af9c6120c2-0
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.960
Those things come together a little bit.

a5569a51-a30d-4fcc-aa0a-24e982304343-0
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.360
And what we're after is a couple of
things.

c780efe7-a234-4351-905e-5d0b419b5dc4-0
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.240
One, an agile mindset from everyone,
right?

1c5c273e-2c86-4685-9402-c36be6b44438-0
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:54.720
So how can we take action now,
learn and iterate?

9c35291d-c920-4ca5-9250-aa5bd666958a-0
00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.800
And that means that we as management,
we need to trust and empower our people.

e0ecb29f-3772-4ef9-86b0-f46ab478b6d7-0
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.868
So a big part of this,
and we've been talking about a lot this

e0ecb29f-3772-4ef9-86b0-f46ab478b6d7-1
00:24:05.868 --> 00:24:09.032
week,
is actually how do we cut the bureaucracy,

e0ecb29f-3772-4ef9-86b0-f46ab478b6d7-2
00:24:09.032 --> 00:24:14.134
remove as much reporting as possible to
free time and to trust and empower our

e0ecb29f-3772-4ef9-86b0-f46ab478b6d7-3
00:24:14.134 --> 00:24:18.720
people who are doing the work to take the
actions, take the decisions.

08b5ef8f-201b-4fe7-bddf-2fb792dadc2b-0
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:26.856
And here it's a lot about also asking you
to identify ruthlessly those areas where

08b5ef8f-201b-4fe7-bddf-2fb792dadc2b-1
00:24:26.856 --> 00:24:32.306
we have waste, waste and processes,
non value add activities,

08b5ef8f-201b-4fe7-bddf-2fb792dadc2b-2
00:24:32.306 --> 00:24:35.120
challenge those and remove them.

a4b165ec-b351-486d-90cd-4ee71918767c-0
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.680
So we create the capacity to do the
things that create real value, right?

8f7e22e5-0522-4fea-9f12-abeafac1a4fa-0
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.520
That's a big part of what we need to do
here.

43d1cf24-388c-40d5-8fd9-c2cedf151c4d-0
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.959
And then we're going to implement a,
a new or an enhanced employee

43d1cf24-388c-40d5-8fd9-c2cedf151c4d-1
00:24:46.959 --> 00:24:51.332
communication system because we believe
very much in transparent frequent

43d1cf24-388c-40d5-8fd9-c2cedf151c4d-2
00:24:51.332 --> 00:24:52.160
communication.

deec3a22-b5b3-40a5-9c78-f9b5c48f9f1e-0
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.040
It's not going to be perfect,
as you've seen already,

deec3a22-b5b3-40a5-9c78-f9b5c48f9f1e-1
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.520
but we want to be super open and we need
everyone to be able to be on the platform,

deec3a22-b5b3-40a5-9c78-f9b5c48f9f1e-2
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.400
to be engaged,
to be part of the conversation, right?

f2a8f501-c4bf-4cf0-921b-04e6aa7837f1-0
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.560
And so we'll need some new tools and
processes for for how to do that.

d2baf6d4-207c-432d-86c3-f791f326146f-0
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:06.840
That's culture.

d9404e04-d5f2-4f5a-8c1c-08c741b227d9-0
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.226
The last piece, AI core,
I've already talked about it a little bit

d9404e04-d5f2-4f5a-8c1c-08c741b227d9-1
00:25:11.226 --> 00:25:11.440
here.

d6807f3c-3f54-45fa-ba84-f4bcfc3facaf-0
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.031
This is about building our own machine
learning stack,

d6807f3c-3f54-45fa-ba84-f4bcfc3facaf-1
00:25:15.031 --> 00:25:19.607
connecting all of our data inflows into
the system and driving insights and

d6807f3c-3f54-45fa-ba84-f4bcfc3facaf-2
00:25:19.607 --> 00:25:23.279
democratizing those insights across the
entire organization.

03e474bd-8cd7-47c3-9a6f-dafd5d54dd8a-0
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:30.066
So my vision for this would be that at
someday in the not too distant future,

03e474bd-8cd7-47c3-9a6f-dafd5d54dd8a-1
00:25:30.066 --> 00:25:35.291
we would have AI agents that are
constantly combing the Internet and

03e474bd-8cd7-47c3-9a6f-dafd5d54dd8a-2
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:41.198
social media platforms to gather insights
on what are people saying about our

03e474bd-8cd7-47c3-9a6f-dafd5d54dd8a-3
00:25:41.198 --> 00:25:41.880
products.

c9b4bea9-1895-4a73-80af-01b3cf046627-0
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.106
And maybe it's combining those with the
call logs that we get from our customer

c9b4bea9-1895-4a73-80af-01b3cf046627-1
00:25:46.106 --> 00:25:49.859
experience and customer support teams and
combining those with the insights from

c9b4bea9-1895-4a73-80af-01b3cf046627-2
00:25:49.859 --> 00:25:53.520
our sales teams through our CRM system
and all of this data flowing in, right?

1cef6faa-1b83-4a90-930e-ee87ea5f9484-0
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.094
And it might be able to tell us in real
time, hey,

1cef6faa-1b83-4a90-930e-ee87ea5f9484-1
00:25:56.094 --> 00:25:58.315
there seems to be people are talking
about,

1cef6faa-1b83-4a90-930e-ee87ea5f9484-2
00:25:58.315 --> 00:26:00.840
I'll just say a quality problem with a
component.

f75622ad-e760-4e53-9010-8b7ec2194418-0
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.120
People are talking about this.

56f6ab40-c119-435f-8b69-ae95f7b6b8ba-0
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:09.751
And then combining those insights,
our AI mother brain will look at our 3D

56f6ab40-c119-435f-8b69-ae95f7b6b8ba-1
00:26:09.751 --> 00:26:16.399
CAD drawings for that part and maybe
generate a potential design improvement,

56f6ab40-c119-435f-8b69-ae95f7b6b8ba-2
00:26:16.399 --> 00:26:22.961
calculate the cost of that improvement,
determine how we can manufacture it,

56f6ab40-c119-435f-8b69-ae95f7b6b8ba-3
00:26:22.961 --> 00:26:28.841
and to deliver to our product owners and
ROI business case for rapid

56f6ab40-c119-435f-8b69-ae95f7b6b8ba-4
00:26:28.841 --> 00:26:30.119
implementation.

a8860253-c9d8-4530-bb71-297453ea31b0-0
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.600
This is here today.

60143bdf-e7d3-4693-b41f-4139be1db6f0-0
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:38.959
It's about us pulling in all of the
information systems into a single fabric

60143bdf-e7d3-4693-b41f-4139be1db6f0-1
00:26:38.959 --> 00:26:44.458
and then building our machine learning
algorithm on top of that to drive

60143bdf-e7d3-4693-b41f-4139be1db6f0-2
00:26:44.458 --> 00:26:46.040
insights and actions.

ec3f873a-b979-4911-a6c4-5100475221c9-0
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.560
That's a glimpse of the vision that we
have for the AI core.

9c14c758-06e7-486b-b280-d967984fd063-0
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.040
Exciting.

3ea3f02a-5f2d-4ba1-af82-027939a4e1fb-0
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.680
I think it's pretty exciting.

5a471cec-4cb3-4dfe-844c-e32977e99ec4-0
00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:02.680
These five elements, Number one,
they reinforce each other.

d3910d22-dae8-4784-8d39-cddcdf6d59cd-0
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.600
So I view it as a flywheel, right?

229a2e43-cb01-4106-a204-22f107febb89-0
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.825
Whenever we can improve our manufacturing
efficiency and implementation of new

229a2e43-cb01-4106-a204-22f107febb89-1
00:27:09.825 --> 00:27:14.720
products in the manufacturing flow that
helps us deliver products faster.

5b3a0f30-fb11-4646-8a8c-d7910b763c27-0
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.120
It helps us become more sticky in the
marketplace, right?

eddc95cc-c06d-4817-9605-6d8c554983d0-0
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.291
Whenever we lean into the cultural change
that we have, of course,

eddc95cc-c06d-4817-9605-6d8c554983d0-1
00:27:21.291 --> 00:27:24.040
it helps us drive all three of these
areas, right?

3d23b33a-9031-4129-bf64-49b8943968c4-0
00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.284
Whenever we drive faster pace of
innovation,

3d23b33a-9031-4129-bf64-49b8943968c4-1
00:27:26.284 --> 00:27:28.280
it creates more brand stickiness, right?

77ec5d19-55ba-43a3-b6f3-28338a7a344b-0
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.920
And so this is a bit of a flywheel.

25a1379c-a581-414d-9217-996b2ecc2369-0
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.120
It's self reinforcing.

c9e59dc2-f526-4467-a243-7ea3f8197e81-0
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.261
And I will tell you, in my view,
that is actually our core competitive

c9e59dc2-f526-4467-a243-7ea3f8197e81-1
00:27:36.261 --> 00:27:38.000
advantage in the future.

68dae02d-565f-478e-a7d8-0a6a79863bd8-0
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.760
It's not a specific feature or function,
but it's actually our way of working.

28a83df2-970d-4531-a986-cb88a85e23b7-0
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.000
Once we get this machine running,
that becomes our competitive advantage.

92f07ce9-3bc4-43ca-b270-77958882a952-0
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.440
This isn't going to be easy.

c9cfeaa2-73a8-4922-9892-5f7474abc5e3-0
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.400
I think as you hear this,
these are quite ambitious targets, right?

b1ea070c-3191-48cf-91e4-13a1a8346ec0-0
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.200
And again,
we won't achieve them next year.

13d9ebcd-086e-4fe5-8f72-6568d17422f6-0
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:02.668
Probably that will make a lot of progress,
but it's going to take all of us and all

13d9ebcd-086e-4fe5-8f72-6568d17422f6-1
00:28:02.668 --> 00:28:03.840
of you to lean in.

f142d56c-7322-4fdf-a336-bc599d558c5a-0
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.280
We're probably going to work harder than
we've ever worked before.

e406d7d4-42a2-4e7f-8b67-5c51bbfb2dbc-0
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.680
I'll just tell you right now, right?

150340b1-7c61-4881-8100-71ffb18837fa-0
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.258
But that work,
my promise to you is that work is going

150340b1-7c61-4881-8100-71ffb18837fa-1
00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:17.370
to be increasingly value add and not
bureaucratic.

150340b1-7c61-4881-8100-71ffb18837fa-2
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.757
The only way we can really ignite the
spark that we need here to regain our

150340b1-7c61-4881-8100-71ffb18837fa-3
00:28:22.757 --> 00:28:26.160
competitive edge from an innovation
standpoint.

250a0cf5-817c-4935-b8d9-bb23cb383171-0
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.754
So let me pause and stop there and we'll
get on with the rest of the program where

250a0cf5-817c-4935-b8d9-bb23cb383171-1
00:28:32.754 --> 00:28:34.760
we dive deeper into these elements.

8369e0b6-5d89-4818-9367-64eecb2c8350-0
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.440
But I only have one question for you guys.

f3756858-d21f-4684-b821-49fa96dc73bd-0
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.120
Are you with me?

a5fb9ca7-f4a6-46cd-8566-7503295300f2-0
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:38.920
Yeah.

ec4cfdd5-f901-4711-a8d6-2eabd7f9d382-0
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.400
All right, Romit.

e743043d-7eb5-48a5-b6e9-9783872a643c-0
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.080
Thank you very much, Chuck.

e1f47d5d-505b-4c8b-b15f-0725e398de41-0
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.600
Katrina, would like to invite you 
onto the stage.

861cf979-3dd0-462f-a5ea-7b2b9913a320-0
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.120
Chuck, you can help me with the furniture?

bb6eff6b-0467-4889-a6aa-7e0608c5a7e4-0
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.360
That's that's my job.

489e48a1-a977-476f-b8b5-6880b42be86e-0
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:54.920
Yes.

9c16940c-b8ce-4670-b555-b91fae9cfd3f-0
00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.200
And I will grab one more,
So please take a seat.

6385f2fc-58d0-4bf0-b68d-f01e4717ab33-0
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:09.360
We're going to talk about innovation
nodes and agile ways of working.

c89ba542-ad28-47c3-b048-3c29a17f80e4-0
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.534
Excuse me.
So many of us will have seen the videos

c89ba542-ad28-47c3-b048-3c29a17f80e4-1
00:29:14.534 --> 00:29:18.847
you put out over the last month,
I guess Chuck talking about innovation

c89ba542-ad28-47c3-b048-3c29a17f80e4-2
00:29:18.847 --> 00:29:23.640
notes, many of us will have seen it,
but let's be conscious, not everybody has.

2e67085f-5886-4559-8d3e-99fe5cec9afb-0
00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.540
So we take a step back and say, so you,
you touched upon it before,

2e67085f-5886-4559-8d3e-99fe5cec9afb-1
00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.880
in the overall overview of the strategy.

f478b429-7a0b-4ee3-893a-441a17724faa-0
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.040
But what are innovation nodes?

adf62944-8cd0-4bdb-86ba-e82adac35ca1-0
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.440
OK, what's an innovation node?

4844b41b-3da5-4e93-a285-4d657e3bd5f6-0
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.972
We know there's a lot of evidence that

4844b41b-3da5-4e93-a285-4d657e3bd5f6-1
00:29:39.972 --> 00:29:44.800
small cross functional fully empowered
teams drive

59cef50b-a9fa-4cb2-809d-c81c33489a5a-0
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.640
innovation velocity and that is in short,
what an innovation node is, right?

4c8b970d-6807-4ac6-a8ea-83970a186442-0
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.518
It's a relatively,
we want to keep them as small as possible,

4c8b970d-6807-4ac6-a8ea-83970a186442-1
00:29:53.518 --> 00:29:55.520
as delayered as possible, right?

e5e6e864-ee3f-4c96-bed7-463accc57c0d-0
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:02.871
In a structure where we have a clear
owner that can take a decision and a team

e5e6e864-ee3f-4c96-bed7-463accc57c0d-1
00:30:02.871 --> 00:30:06.120
that is focused on the task at hand,
right?

1ce9d932-fd6e-464a-bb6d-6e6450f2e98b-0
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.320
I mean, that's,
the idea of an innovation node.

612c6112-f6be-4b26-98e5-3d9a8006cbaa-0
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.280
Think of it as a independent startup
company within the company.

b97f7f72-af96-4b4d-8740-be14c301868e-0
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.720
OK, so that's going to be the structure.

b2a3bb97-6eb9-4556-a764-37cec30916d7-0
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.480
Now how do we want these innovation nodes
to work?

95c4cdc4-9d2d-4e06-8c92-071a778cac5a-0
00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.720
Catharina, that one's for you.

a3fb0970-6f59-4a24-b0bd-3b6abee7a55c-0
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:19.360
Yes.

8a400fd5-573f-4a94-b25b-23bb6a395355-0
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.509
So we want to work in an agile way and
this is something that you heard Chuck

8a400fd5-573f-4a94-b25b-23bb6a395355-1
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:24.840
talk a lot about already.

57aaf9cc-c1ac-4266-9e33-9e4049f5dd75-0
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.400
Agile.

a6c2c961-4c7b-49a2-8f5a-8e8e4f069aaf-0
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.600
What does that actually mean?

76babb24-135d-4cb5-a95a-d7d9839359ad-0
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.084
Well,
it means that we will work in iterative

76babb24-135d-4cb5-a95a-d7d9839359ad-1
00:30:30.084 --> 00:30:31.600
fast feedback loops.

77cb5e88-6391-4acc-8be4-27e533345f71-0
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.600
We will have all the people that is
needed into the working team.

e833d72a-d42c-43ad-913e-b4ea95e10de6-0
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.937
It's a cross functional team working
together, fixing,

e833d72a-d42c-43ad-913e-b4ea95e10de6-1
00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:40.880
working with a specific problem.

da386be2-3f5d-41f4-ab0a-170766176a45-0
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.155
And they do that in those iterative
processes where you get,

da386be2-3f5d-41f4-ab0a-170766176a45-1
00:30:45.155 --> 00:30:49.946
you learn fast and you fail fast so that
you learn again and then you become

da386be2-3f5d-41f4-ab0a-170766176a45-2
00:30:49.946 --> 00:30:52.560
better and better and better all the time.

88795671-e2e0-44d9-9a41-b21382e4dfdd-0
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.440
And this will then create speed into the
organization.

7cf7a7d4-47c8-4afa-bf33-89df48f6cdc2-0
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:04.015
So taking away all the obstacles,
taking away the waste that we have today

7cf7a7d4-47c8-4afa-bf33-89df48f6cdc2-1
00:31:04.015 --> 00:31:07.040
and move with a very quick way forward.

c264ec9d-6069-42b8-9918-caeaed8d59cc-0
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:07.640
OK.

cb5d25fd-7369-4818-8004-b5e4e8fa4339-0
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.850
And so I'm guessing there are other
approaches we could have taken,

cb5d25fd-7369-4818-8004-b5e4e8fa4339-1
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.132
even if you use the same structure of
innovation nodes,

cb5d25fd-7369-4818-8004-b5e4e8fa4339-2
00:31:13.132 --> 00:31:14.639
we could have taken other approaches.

e7920a52-7496-455a-b2c0-9bbedcbd41d7-0
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.365
So why have we chosen Agile as our
framework methodology,

e7920a52-7496-455a-b2c0-9bbedcbd41d7-1
00:31:18.365 --> 00:31:21.920
bearing in mind what you said, Chuck,
about that's the label.

a4826c0d-20c4-459c-8d33-593dee4e7f5f-0
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.640
We don't have to worry about the exact
definition.

8d75292e-e443-40ef-b56a-67921e6ef721-0
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.840
We will apply our own take on it.

26981404-9a03-4170-a6c0-74361a8828e8-0
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.520
Why take that general approach?

1cd86347-b195-42db-86c7-2ea4871ca581-0
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.400
Yeah, Yeah.

e689a968-114c-403f-9870-b4b2c0771d8f-0
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.160
And it is the label.

a16e9d23-ea27-405d-9936-fdf4bdbcbc83-0
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.400
The label is not important.

26d87773-9f17-40e2-832e-172d6edad196-0
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.414
When I started acting in an agile way 25
years ago,

26d87773-9f17-40e2-832e-172d6edad196-1
00:31:34.414 --> 00:31:36.760
I didn't know it was called Agile, right?

08f6a9bc-4d94-457d-a6e1-080f4eb9a6ce-0
00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.244
It was just how do you take action,
learn from it, and fail fast,

08f6a9bc-4d94-457d-a6e1-080f4eb9a6ce-1
00:31:41.244 --> 00:31:42.400
as Catharina said.

a89f2934-9616-485f-baa4-f871f8b32d77-0
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.762
Now, of course,
there have been a lot of studies and

a89f2934-9616-485f-baa4-f871f8b32d77-1
00:31:46.762 --> 00:31:49.753
research that shows without a doubt,

a89f2934-9616-485f-baa4-f871f8b32d77-2
00:31:49.753 --> 00:31:53.628
that it delivers not only the fastest
innovation cycles,

a89f2934-9616-485f-baa4-f871f8b32d77-3
00:31:53.628 --> 00:31:58.998
but actually the best quality and the
most the products that are received most

a89f2934-9616-485f-baa4-f871f8b32d77-4
00:31:58.998 --> 00:32:03.756
favorably by the market, right,
because you're constantly learning in

a89f2934-9616-485f-baa4-f871f8b32d77-5
00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:04.640
short cycles.

454c8433-364d-49c8-b020-fea5cde22dc7-0
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.740
And then I would also just say,
if I could layer on top of that and,

454c8433-364d-49c8-b020-fea5cde22dc7-1
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.993
and some folks in this room have heard me
say this, you know,

454c8433-364d-49c8-b020-fea5cde22dc7-2
00:32:11.993 --> 00:32:14.879
in a waterfall based approach,
we spend a lot of time,

454c8433-364d-49c8-b020-fea5cde22dc7-3
00:32:14.879 --> 00:32:18.132
weeks in some cases,
trying to plan out what the project plan

454c8433-364d-49c8-b020-fea5cde22dc7-4
00:32:18.132 --> 00:32:18.919
is going to be.

be547e59-2eba-4225-b6d4-d8ab01a3262d-0
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.320
And the only thing we know is that it's
wrong, right?

63978b87-76f8-4752-8661-fdb188b3ec01-0
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.998
It's the only thing you know,
And then we ask our teams to come and

63978b87-76f8-4752-8661-fdb188b3ec01-1
00:32:26.998 --> 00:32:31.435
report to us and management once a month
and tell us and explain to us why it was

63978b87-76f8-4752-8661-fdb188b3ec01-2
00:32:31.435 --> 00:32:31.760
wrong.

3b41c062-0b69-4411-8d8f-f98893db037c-0
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.280
I don't think that's very fun.

1d8244e9-0405-478a-9d93-d2836d0f484c-0
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.400
It's not really a very motivating style
to work in.

77ecf1fc-74e6-4333-9617-5171e5ae2294-0
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:44.040
And so in an agile mindset,
we focus on taking action and learnings

77ecf1fc-74e6-4333-9617-5171e5ae2294-1
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.640
here and now, right?

ad180b84-1da1-4a67-ac1a-03d9b2e5dd25-0
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:51.810
And you take a leap of faith that it's
going to lead to a product launch date

ad180b84-1da1-4a67-ac1a-03d9b2e5dd25-1
00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.840
that is early as possible.

2fe6222e-2fe0-4436-a2c4-20c8402a6657-0
00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.090
And if I may just kind of add on to your,

2fe6222e-2fe0-4436-a2c4-20c8402a6657-1
00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.280
so we talked about quality here and
saying that.

bea6358b-4d36-4e82-921d-7dbe34366476-0
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.600
So how can agile actually then improve
quality?

8725a456-d45d-40fd-a7ad-6d8ae248d33f-0
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.921
Well,
by getting those fast feedback loops then

8725a456-d45d-40fd-a7ad-6d8ae248d33f-1
00:33:05.921 --> 00:33:06.960
you understand.

85f06605-da81-4702-b28a-11b2ff17446e-0
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.440
So where is the problem?

bd5b20ea-ed2f-4a98-9ac9-36eedd2aba3e-0
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.880
What quality problem do I need to solve?

6bfdf4f4-801c-4acd-944e-020db000c870-0
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.200
And then you can fix it quickly.

63305822-c753-4cce-a849-50cd91c5f9b4-0
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:18.910
You don't need to go through a full
process of, you know, decision for us,

63305822-c753-4cce-a849-50cd91c5f9b4-1
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.760
documentations, etcetera.

000cfe53-b2e6-4749-9e19-28144d89f6a6-0
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.120
You get that feedback into the team right
away.

ab6dc4d0-7567-47bb-b8fd-4ec451a41ec3-0
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.560
We will be able to do this from the start.

1074ec6f-1dc3-48f1-8cd6-c112078b5a37-0
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.640
Most likely not,
but we will learn as we do as well.

9b81dc51-ab55-4c0a-a3cb-473d6c0e2ce2-0
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.136
And what study shows also is that this
will actually also create a lot higher

9b81dc51-ab55-4c0a-a3cb-473d6c0e2ce2-1
00:33:35.136 --> 00:33:38.174
employee satisfaction because you as
employees,

9b81dc51-ab55-4c0a-a3cb-473d6c0e2ce2-2
00:33:38.174 --> 00:33:43.173
you will know what you're focusing on and
we will work together in solving the

9b81dc51-ab55-4c0a-a3cb-473d6c0e2ce2-3
00:33:43.173 --> 00:33:43.680
problem.

389b2690-0eba-46c9-bef8-6d472f2288af-0
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.513
It's not just that you're handing over
something to another organization and

389b2690-0eba-46c9-bef8-6d472f2288af-1
00:33:47.513 --> 00:33:50.062
saying, hey,
I've now done this and now you two need to

389b2690-0eba-46c9-bef8-6d472f2288af-2
00:33:50.062 --> 00:33:50.440
do this.

7ea395ed-a239-4038-b5d6-3bca2fa23ffe-0
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.091
No, we work together in solving these

7ea395ed-a239-4038-b5d6-3bca2fa23ffe-1
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:53.720
problems.

60c7f609-8de5-49a8-b55b-7faf8a7891d6-0
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.230
So that's going to be we're going to see
people thinking or we want people to

60c7f609-8de5-49a8-b55b-7faf8a7891d6-1
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.840
think more about the full process - 
the full... not using the word process -

60c7f609-8de5-49a8-b55b-7faf8a7891d6-2
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.600
the the bigger picture. The flow. Yes,
you need you want things to go fast.

21ba7108-c9e2-466a-9f24-31d86dc15064-0
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.444
You want you want everybody in
organization to help out to make things

21ba7108-c9e2-466a-9f24-31d86dc15064-1
00:34:09.444 --> 00:34:12.098
go fast,
not just your particular part of the of

21ba7108-c9e2-466a-9f24-31d86dc15064-2
00:34:12.098 --> 00:34:12.640
the wheel.

56bff4b3-5cea-4c99-b86a-e43286757102-0
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.680
OK.

b9207813-c2d8-4015-8322-47537e295189-0
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.552
Now, when you first announced 
on Viva Engage

b9207813-c2d8-4015-8322-47537e295189-1
00:34:16.552 --> 00:34:20.515
that we were going to have
innovation notes and of course you said

b9207813-c2d8-4015-8322-47537e295189-2
00:34:20.515 --> 00:34:24.320
that we would have one for our next
generation of SmartDrive products.

0039690f-702f-4033-82cc-b6d426fdfa92-0
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.320
I'm sure you've had this question before.

ab41dece-e897-49da-83bc-5c5a817f743e-0
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.160
I'm sure everyone has the same question.

33ebd5b6-39d2-40f7-857e-e623c278dc3d-0
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.880
What's the next innovation nodes that
we're going to be seeing?

1c0531da-7708-4ad9-9de2-1a111c2d7fd1-0
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.560
Oh, boy, that's a good one.

930867a9-0f80-415d-8caf-17ddecd6379a-0
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.560
It's an obvious one.

cc614699-85c3-4b5b-aef8-dbb169141768-0
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.520
Yeah, Yeah, it's good.

55f1c1fb-f58b-436e-9746-619e1ade8a8e-0
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.983
I mean,
I would say I don't know if this is to me

55f1c1fb-f58b-436e-9746-619e1ade8a8e-1
00:34:37.983 --> 00:34:39.560
or to Katharina, it was for you.

b991aab8-4253-4763-8a90-f3960f48d23a-0
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.000
OK.

69a6be63-b6e9-4b67-b216-21677d7e8617-0
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.400
All right.

e9f4c94c-1ee2-4d6f-9860-e376c7d3628b-0
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.240
According, I mean,
I think they become quite obvious, right?

e7caf0c2-501a-4f08-837a-a707178253a5-0
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.816
Of course,
we will have one or more nodes around

e7caf0c2-501a-4f08-837a-a707178253a5-1
00:34:50.816 --> 00:34:51.680
power, right?

77e7270f-eaa7-4f0c-a1cc-a18ac63c3737-0
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.260
Ultimately,
this will be the way we work with all of

77e7270f-eaa7-4f0c-a1cc-a18ac63c3737-1
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.320
our innovation across all of our product
segments.

9d8241cd-a4d7-44b4-9b99-a57ae2f474eb-0
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.930
And then it's a matter of what's the
right balance based on that particular

9d8241cd-a4d7-44b4-9b99-a57ae2f474eb-1
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:07.047
product area for it to be a large node
with lots of teams under it or a small

9d8241cd-a4d7-44b4-9b99-a57ae2f474eb-2
00:35:07.047 --> 00:35:09.000
node with maybe just one team, right.

44a61588-b88d-40a1-8d93-0ed12fe5f83a-0
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.680
And that will depend on the platform that
you're working with.

0d1bc2a3-82b7-44b0-bde5-146035ee35c9-0
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.080
And this is something that I didn't hit
on, if I may and I'll just keep talking.

492f2e00-f7c3-4b04-b6a2-4764411c0d02-0
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:21.400
So you'll have to is this really requires
a platform thinking it's a mind shift.

dcc9f52d-acf6-4e18-96f4-d595b3defe6d-0
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.450
The way that we have funded our projects
in the past is we've said we're going to

dcc9f52d-acf6-4e18-96f4-d595b3defe6d-1
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:29.314
we need a business case and we're going
to fund a product launch and what...

dcc9f52d-acf6-4e18-96f4-d595b3defe6d-2
00:35:29.314 --> 00:35:32.200
and then we're probably not going to fund
it again, right?

8c1fb234-92e8-42b5-9ca8-a86fca530a27-0
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.640
It's a one time solitaire, if you will.

aaacee0d-ccba-4d53-82a0-52506ce91f19-0
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.900
And what that means is we then need to
get every feature and every function and

aaacee0d-ccba-4d53-82a0-52506ce91f19-1
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.807
the best quality and everything we could
possibly ever want in that product during

aaacee0d-ccba-4d53-82a0-52506ce91f19-2
00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:46.432
that product development cycle because
we're probably not going to come back

aaacee0d-ccba-4d53-82a0-52506ce91f19-3
00:35:46.432 --> 00:35:48.079
around and work on it again, right?

200f861c-cd6f-470e-abe7-e0873516f8ba-0
00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.480
That's a product mindset,
if you will.

0fc87ae8-b1c4-461f-96d8-1137e1bfffc2-0
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.925
And here the product nodes or the
innovation nodes are going to be focused

0fc87ae8-b1c4-461f-96d8-1137e1bfffc2-1
00:35:54.925 --> 00:35:55.640
on platforms.

e2aa4f17-9db8-4113-bca4-9390b5ec3aae-0
00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.217
So we will fund these as platforms and
therefore adopt a what we, 

e2aa4f17-9db8-4113-bca4-9390b5ec3aae-1
00:36:00.217 --> 00:36:03.971
as you may have heard,
a minimal lovable product mindset to get

e2aa4f17-9db8-4113-bca4-9390b5ec3aae-2
00:36:03.971 --> 00:36:07.315
it out quickly,
but we'll continue to fund that platform

e2aa4f17-9db8-4113-bca4-9390b5ec3aae-3
00:36:07.315 --> 00:36:10.600
over the life over and over again.
Over and over again.

fbe944d4-674a-4e57-9b24-6da53c1d1972-0
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.920
Yes, work with constant improvements,
as well.

cfaa1093-bee4-4381-b7bb-b01a28dd869a-0
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.640
But in general, if you understand,
So what are the next innovation notes?

1e68d196-d780-4b03-94b3-cca123017633-0
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.606
I think that it's would be easy to say we
have certain product areas that we are

1e68d196-d780-4b03-94b3-cca123017633-1
00:36:23.606 --> 00:36:28.330
focusing on right now and of course,
they will become in one way or the other

1e68d196-d780-4b03-94b3-cca123017633-2
00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.360
innovation notes.

ad5b15dc-ba1e-4187-bccc-ee0b3c255e72-0
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.200
Absolutely.

8e75ed23-da8d-4396-8c86-8889f51a0434-0
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.920
OK, Exciting.

61417b37-a5e7-4a22-83e8-f6595672b3f7-0
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.924
So we'll see those kind of formal,
informal announcements coming up over the

61417b37-a5e7-4a22-83e8-f6595672b3f7-1
00:36:35.924 --> 00:36:37.400
next days, weeks and months.

ac20ae79-838e-4ab2-b1b9-4f9412906b75-0
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.756
I was going to say even communications
could be an innovation node,

ac20ae79-838e-4ab2-b1b9-4f9412906b75-1
00:36:41.756 --> 00:36:44.116
but we already decided that the
definition of a,

ac20ae79-838e-4ab2-b1b9-4f9412906b75-2
00:36:44.116 --> 00:36:47.200
of a innovation node is you have to have
at least one engineer.

959cc715-2dd4-4865-ad77-fb958e2da22a-0
00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.840
We're happy to take an engineer onto
our team.

12d81677-a466-4b76-8966-13e9cec597c9-0
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.280
No, I have no qualms about that.

c3f79967-8b8f-4ea2-8a99-1675cc9f6366-0
00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.920
Some of my best friends are engineers.

86304bb1-dad6-4076-bede-6ce139bca6b8-0
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.840
You can hear that those are friends of
the team.

6a6ef8e4-70c8-432a-bd8d-b27da960dd4a-0
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:57.440
Yes.

a3d44beb-bfb4-4b86-94a4-46658eee2717-0
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.560
OK, thank you very much.

aa4ce185-3833-4e70-9379-87c1bd3a2499-0
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.027
Sorry,
but maybe then just to comment again,

aa4ce185-3833-4e70-9379-87c1bd3a2499-1
00:37:02.027 --> 00:37:05.975
then is it only the kind of the
innovation notes that are going to work

aa4ce185-3833-4e70-9379-87c1bd3a2499-2
00:37:05.975 --> 00:37:07.840
in, in, in an agile matter, Chuck?

a0021e42-0de7-4ead-aed8-46f481e6147a-0
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.120
No, no, we all need an agile mindset,
right?

c20203d5-1230-406e-92d9-342609062a14-0
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:16.960
The way we fund projects and areas will
be agile, right?

2ccbda13-45f4-44b5-8944-ee34c17d7913-0
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.480
We need to instead of locking ourselves
into rigid platforms.

218951e1-fdb3-4cbb-ae74-e7e722fc15ef-0
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.200
It's, it's about pace of change.

f38e9fcb-51f6-40a9-8a93-47cae6421f0d-0
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.800
So maybe just kind of a call for action.

fe29335f-30b3-49ab-941c-c20129c844bf-0
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.436
Then from from my side,
it's actually done to say, hey,

fe29335f-30b3-49ab-941c-c20129c844bf-1
00:37:27.436 --> 00:37:31.108
be curious and try to understand what
does Agile mean and what would actually

fe29335f-30b3-49ab-941c-c20129c844bf-2
00:37:31.108 --> 00:37:31.720
mean for you.

6123470b-10ef-4c3a-a377-daaee1c88349-0
00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.960
So everyone works in Agile,
everyone be curious.

e810f560-726c-42a6-830e-bc00c609b0ed-0
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.642
Nodes will be focused on product
development,

e810f560-726c-42a6-830e-bc00c609b0ed-1
00:37:38.642 --> 00:37:41.520
but not only product development,
innovation in general.

fc953009-939d-4cc8-be35-312000796ba1-0
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.680
Yep, great.

c34d9aaa-0782-4e6b-ba38-1d4f5c8dc0c1-0
00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:43.960
Thank you very much.

d9dd4f61-89c1-4aba-9ca4-0ca14f9ac94d-0
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.280
Thank you.

cf661c49-0995-4395-9eec-908c0b255763-0
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.840
We'll see you back at the end for the
Q&amp;A section.

4ff757bd-d971-4b48-914e-e02349f8538a-0
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:47.800
Thank you.

b5a70f19-9c55-49c7-920f-0d4be92a9a35-0
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.400
Thank you very much.

0fc78593-3811-4252-8dac-d87e050faa7a-0
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:54.533
So and of course that kind of gives us a
great segue into our next part of the

0fc78593-3811-4252-8dac-d87e050faa7a-1
00:37:54.533 --> 00:37:58.492
town hall,
which is the reason why we're all here,

0fc78593-3811-4252-8dac-d87e050faa7a-2
00:37:58.492 --> 00:38:02.840
the reason why we're all at Permobil is
our end users.

af263819-c052-4601-9079-ffb64acc454c-0
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.643
You know,
our core value is user first and that's a

af263819-c052-4601-9079-ffb64acc454c-1
00:38:05.643 --> 00:38:08.558
focus and we talk about  pace of
innovation,

af263819-c052-4601-9079-ffb64acc454c-2
00:38:08.558 --> 00:38:13.043
getting products out to market earlier,
but it's not really products to market,

af263819-c052-4601-9079-ffb64acc454c-3
00:38:13.043 --> 00:38:17.360
it's products to individuals because
we're here to innovate for individuals.

43f35bca-7349-43e5-affd-856af1f77143-0
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.131
Last week I had an opportunity to meet a
fantastic young entrepreneur who talked

43f35bca-7349-43e5-affd-856af1f77143-1
00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:26.680
to us about about her,
her start up that she's running.

c8c72048-537f-4800-b6d9-e4fa7837dfa4-0
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.800
She also happens to be a a Pantera user.

6ae64c2a-cc87-4f67-8751-18bef33b604b-0
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.775
Some of you, especially the Swedes,
might remember her from when she was on

6ae64c2a-cc87-4f67-8751-18bef33b604b-1
00:38:34.775 --> 00:38:38.833
the first series of the Swedish TV show
Shark Tank or Dragon's Den,

6ae64c2a-cc87-4f67-8751-18bef33b604b-2
00:38:38.833 --> 00:38:41.280
depending on which country it's aired in.

39cca062-35c1-41ec-a785-58ba81dd07bf-0
00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.597
And she famously turned down 3 investors
who offered to invest in a startup

39cca062-35c1-41ec-a785-58ba81dd07bf-1
00:38:45.597 --> 00:38:48.200
because it didn't really give her what
she needed.

64052a8d-d697-4128-b8c7-16a9f02b4641-0
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.280
So let's hear her story.

b180252f-92a8-4936-86c9-2121912a540f-0
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.740
Thank you very much, Alexandra,
for giving up your time to to be here

b180252f-92a8-4936-86c9-2121912a540f-1
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.400
with us today.

40a78f94-2b6f-4456-926f-8740a906523c-0
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.640
Do you want me to start off just telling
us a few words about yourself?

f2025b31-eb1a-4a25-9a30-d25d9dac84ba-0
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:16.920
Yeah, of course.

6780035b-8f6e-4b3c-8dff-f1f49748f971-0
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.360
Thank you for having me with you today.

c95b53d2-e8a5-410c-a573-e386d64278c0-0
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.200
So my name is Rim Alexander Halfya.

e30af115-dbf1-4874-bbdc-4f607ac85ce0-0
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.880
People call me Alexandra.

86daa0a8-9701-4490-ab52-fc52b054cb57-0
00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.760
I am 33 and I'm an entrepreneur.

c0d752db-ebbb-43d3-9956-e03737f5bf2d-0
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.120
I'm going to talk about it soon.

5b596dd4-9ba2-4c9a-9cf2-3503b604ace7-0
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.186
My company Combify,
which is a tech company within the

5b596dd4-9ba2-4c9a-9cf2-3503b604ace7-1
00:39:39.186 --> 00:39:44.084
real estate industry,
but I'm also a humanitarian and a public

5b596dd4-9ba2-4c9a-9cf2-3503b604ace7-2
00:39:44.084 --> 00:39:44.760
speaker.

13857e13-f27f-4d20-a9eb-bb2a1b65345c-0
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.120
So you mentioned that you're one of the
co-founders of Combify.

14040916-ad57-4556-964e-a11cec7fcd72-0
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.040
Can you just explain what that is?

412281a8-0bc3-4dc0-9498-32ce07816448-0
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:53.480
Yeah.

33bfb316-de03-43d2-9673-ca8fd5550c64-0
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.015
So Combify is a tech platform that
gathers all of the information on

33bfb316-de03-43d2-9673-ca8fd5550c64-1
00:39:58.015 --> 00:40:02.120
property and unbuilt properties in all of
Sweden in one place.

859d6062-e74a-4318-b5f0-fcb3cb458260-0
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:07.453
So we help property developers to find
unbuilt land so that they could have

859d6062-e74a-4318-b5f0-fcb3cb458260-1
00:40:07.453 --> 00:40:11.642
their next project,
and also for architects to find where the

859d6062-e74a-4318-b5f0-fcb3cb458260-2
00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:15.560
public tenders and the competitions for
them to end jobs.

00e1d20c-05aa-4697-94fd-e784306d9b44-0
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.211
So yeah, of course when it comes to tech,
AI is the next big thing. Everyone is talking

00e1d20c-05aa-4697-94fd-e784306d9b44-1
00:40:20.211 --> 00:40:21.960
about to see how they can use it.

f27968a6-ddcc-4ba5-acc6-fc9af6a4f8f2-0
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.360
How are you using AI in Combify?

7d0a8777-c6bc-43d9-ab11-0fbf78255763-0
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.640
Yeah, so definitely.

ab330cff-9e6a-4f0b-bb54-786cad36ba0e-0
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:33.479
You know, like when open AI became
a trend, like ChatGPT,

ab330cff-9e6a-4f0b-bb54-786cad36ba0e-1
00:40:33.479 --> 00:40:38.130
it was the last couple of years,
before that, we spent so many years

ab330cff-9e6a-4f0b-bb54-786cad36ba0e-2
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:42.846
in gathering data about all the ongoing
and planned construction projects

ab330cff-9e6a-4f0b-bb54-786cad36ba0e-3
00:40:42.846 --> 00:40:44.720
historical and in the future.

1554240b-45d7-44ff-99eb-b22af75bba68-0
00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:51.467
All of the data on property ownership
information, all of the building permits,

1554240b-45d7-44ff-99eb-b22af75bba68-1
00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:58.174
all of the tenders and we found a way
with machine learning to gather this data

1554240b-45d7-44ff-99eb-b22af75bba68-2
00:40:58.174 --> 00:41:04.242
from different websites in different
formats and to connect them to

1554240b-45d7-44ff-99eb-b22af75bba68-3
00:41:04.242 --> 00:41:05.759
the right property.

59792b4e-14ba-448c-8e6c-1264898b7947-0
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.560
So we've already been doing that
with open AI.

46854423-be4c-4f41-b422-d6c31d200e3a-0
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:17.297
It gave us a opportunity to leverage this
data, that we have spent so much time and

46854423-be4c-4f41-b422-d6c31d200e3a-1
00:41:17.297 --> 00:41:18.840
resources to build.

38811b1c-464a-476f-88ef-7b29696d64ad-0
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.645
So now we can, actually, instead of,
you know,

38811b1c-464a-476f-88ef-7b29696d64ad-1
00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:25.465
building a platform that whenever
you have an extra data set,

38811b1c-464a-476f-88ef-7b29696d64ad-2
00:41:25.465 --> 00:41:28.999
you have to build a new feature for it to
show this data set.

91cdbe3a-179f-4165-ab45-0e86be4e549d-0
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.549
Now our users,
a property developer for example,

91cdbe3a-179f-4165-ab45-0e86be4e549d-1
00:41:32.549 --> 00:41:37.886
can just chat with our platform and you
will be met with a question, for example,

91cdbe3a-179f-4165-ab45-0e86be4e549d-2
00:41:37.886 --> 00:41:40.880
what do you want to know about this
property?

b0050cdf-806b-43c5-8044-3a0ecfd862c6-0
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.295
And I'm like,
who owns it and what's going to be built

b0050cdf-806b-43c5-8044-3a0ecfd862c6-1
00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:47.800
in the area for the next 5 years?

fd7b7812-9aba-4714-b428-1bf6721b4cc1-0
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:52.960
Anything that may obstruct a building of
a school here and etcetera.

1fc4882a-01e6-471f-a811-d9f719ae75f4-0
00:41:53.280 --> 00:42:01.400
So now, because I always talk about AI
without data quality data is useless.

89620002-8bf9-4ceb-8e1f-1206054c3904-0
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.373
So now we can really leverage the power
of AI and make the information even more

89620002-8bf9-4ceb-8e1f-1206054c3904-1
00:42:06.373 --> 00:42:07.800
accessible to our users.

6f5d4df2-2d47-473f-991a-7e8f0d5c005f-0
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.373
So I assume that you do a lot of your
work on video calls as many of us do

6f5d4df2-2d47-473f-991a-7e8f0d5c005f-1
00:42:13.373 --> 00:42:14.120
these days.

d0278d49-d946-43ae-a9f9-8e1a5e3b12ac-0
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.803
How do you find people react to you when
you meet them face to face when perhaps

d0278d49-d946-43ae-a9f9-8e1a5e3b12ac-1
00:42:18.803 --> 00:42:20.360
you first met them on a video call?

5594995a-31bc-4113-a033-81c8a9a54c03-0
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.855
I mean,
it's a bit different from now in

5594995a-31bc-4113-a033-81c8a9a54c03-1
00:42:23.855 --> 00:42:25.400
comparison to before.

4c8aa20d-7464-4701-a795-a910fc49de69-0
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.840
So before I've always been met, you know,
like with respect and all of that.

42476a6b-3638-44de-8930-8258539c20bc-0
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:35.036
But in the beginning people before you're
like having a meeting,

42476a6b-3638-44de-8930-8258539c20bc-1
00:42:35.036 --> 00:42:39.624
let's say that I would have a meeting the
first time in someone else's office and

42476a6b-3638-44de-8930-8258539c20bc-2
00:42:39.624 --> 00:42:40.240
not online.

91fdb7ae-21d3-482e-b412-5d05cac92be3-0
00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.567
So that would be the first time that
person who like hears me talk about my

91fdb7ae-21d3-482e-b412-5d05cac92be3-1
00:42:44.567 --> 00:42:45.080
business.

a541f3bf-a960-44cb-8c3b-0202dcbb9ab4-0
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:49.634
So I see a bit of a lag, you know, oh,

a541f3bf-a960-44cb-8c3b-0202dcbb9ab4-1
00:42:49.634 --> 00:42:54.360
but the image does not really match in a
positive way.

62cba072-68d2-42ed-92e0-d988989f913f-0
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.440
So I think I'm breaking stereotypes
whenever that happens.

dc4d413c-4c51-4645-99bc-550af062787b-0
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:04.202
And so, yeah, in the beginning I used to,
you know, like explain a lot, you know,

dc4d413c-4c51-4645-99bc-550af062787b-1
00:43:04.202 --> 00:43:06.240
like why I'm in a wheelchair.

b15f394d-47b2-420a-a186-2a8b25181adb-0
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.200
That happened in a car accident when I
was a teenager and all of that.

86703770-78b7-4dea-97ef-23fde744b990-0
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:15.711
But then I understood later on because
now I'm not only a person in a wheelchair,

86703770-78b7-4dea-97ef-23fde744b990-1
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:16.680
I am a woman.

6dfb7192-4607-4aed-8b1c-3c46c5344041-0
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.040
I am young.

e85548f7-f350-42cf-83ab-e9791b78a887-0
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:25.040
I come from another background than,
you know, like originally Swedish.

7dcaf001-6de8-47ab-988b-8b724792f1af-0
00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:30.520
So I'm breaking a lot of stereotypes and
I'm very man dominated industry.

1b95f740-eced-4a59-b893-7e84c98bbf20-0
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.025
It sounds very inspiring what you're
doing and facing or breaking down so many

1b95f740-eced-4a59-b893-7e84c98bbf20-1
00:43:35.025 --> 00:43:37.440
of the different barriers that you
mentioned.

0e999bfe-7bc7-49a5-8510-2b9fa1019de8-0
00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.760
So thank you very much for your time.

dd4f51a1-c7fc-4cf9-b65a-b73207a87a4a-0
00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.440
Thank you.

527af996-3853-4cef-9f24-6f0484c92ae6-0
00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.452
So unfortunately we had to cut that
interview short for for what we could

527af996-3853-4cef-9f24-6f0484c92ae6-1
00:43:49.452 --> 00:43:52.125
show today,
but we are going to make the full length

527af996-3853-4cef-9f24-6f0484c92ae6-2
00:43:52.125 --> 00:43:55.000
interview available through the usual
internal channels

85a146d9-e04d-4836-b39c-06db94a11077-0
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:55.760
afterwards.

1c3c99c2-96fa-45da-a012-6b2862ce7c87-0
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.490
You can hear about her experience being
on the TV show Dragons Den Shark Tank,

1c3c99c2-96fa-45da-a012-6b2862ce7c87-1
00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:05.037
as well as her feedback to our R&amp;
D department about what changes she would

1c3c99c2-96fa-45da-a012-6b2862ce7c87-2
00:44:05.037 --> 00:44:05.720
like to see.

af57e76b-a9cb-4155-bc2f-7fe0c05ca57d-0
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.337
Now I'd like to welcome Bruce,
Todd and Marcus - had to make sure I got

af57e76b-a9cb-4155-bc2f-7fe0c05ca57d-1
00:44:10.337 --> 00:44:11.600
the order right there.

3b918857-7673-425b-804d-48f7601daa9d-0
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.760
Here to talk about Brand Stickiness.

771b614a-3654-4d76-b32b-254a1fb2d31f-0
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.080
So let's start from the very beginning.

0bce1eb7-c01e-4482-9bbf-60bb3987daea-0
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:15.840
Let's keep it simple.

42030051-4307-455c-96ad-152ba7bab34e-0
00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.600
What is Brand Stickiness, Bruce?

910f339f-d4f8-4c90-8bac-8d7eac141292-0
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.200
Yeah.

63160ac1-3d9a-48ce-bbca-4daf3e2379ca-0
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.076
So brand stickiness,
it's it's not really just a marketing

63160ac1-3d9a-48ce-bbca-4daf3e2379ca-1
00:44:21.076 --> 00:44:21.320
tool.

09b90769-8828-450e-9233-62faeeece68f-0
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.605
It has to do with every way we interact
with our users that whether it be product

09b90769-8828-450e-9233-62faeeece68f-1
00:44:25.605 --> 00:44:27.957
development,
whether it be customer service,

09b90769-8828-450e-9233-62faeeece68f-2
00:44:27.957 --> 00:44:31.929
whether it be our sales reps or our
marketing people or through our digital

09b90769-8828-450e-9233-62faeeece68f-3
00:44:31.929 --> 00:44:32.400
channels.

2cde7c56-d6b4-4d80-bdf4-c434a2d05916-0
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.139
When you think of a company like Apple,
it's very,

2cde7c56-d6b4-4d80-bdf4-c434a2d05916-1
00:44:36.139 --> 00:44:40.553
very difficult if you're a Apple fan to
actually walk by the Apple Store without

2cde7c56-d6b4-4d80-bdf4-c434a2d05916-2
00:44:40.553 --> 00:44:41.480
wanting to go in.

2433d832-06a4-42a5-992d-ccf721fc5a92-0
00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.208
When they launch a new product,
you want to be the first one there in

2433d832-06a4-42a5-992d-ccf721fc5a92-1
00:44:45.208 --> 00:44:47.760
line with millions of people either
online or offline.

45e9b708-bbde-4843-bb2f-f81cd9735172-0
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.282
They've hooked you,
they've got you so that any time that

45e9b708-bbde-4843-bb2f-f81cd9735172-1
00:44:51.282 --> 00:44:54.040
they launch a product,
you know you want to be there.

4e82b63e-d7a6-4878-aa21-d7d7361be8d6-0
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.320
And it's critical for us at Permobil to
create this brand stickiness.

d46f9e5b-68dd-414b-a3ea-0aafeb069791-0
00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.560
We've done this in the past.

8ea6793f-9460-4e02-a167-904ffd5960bd-0
00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.865
Permobil in Sweden is recognized as a
wheelchair independent of what brand it is


2c378d7b-8762-40b9-8612-15e8597c92bf-0
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.800
ROHO in Canada, for example,
is trained in the PT schools.

4a7e3520-b687-4dc2-9098-632c845369cb-0
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:16.200
So when somebody leaves their training,
they prescribe a ROHO cushion for people.

c99d7bb7-58a3-4c45-8387-fea6f9699019-0
00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.080
Same in Korea.

0d66bb13-3666-4b23-bfe9-8dfdc7b6f692-0
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.568
And for us,
it's going to be really important that we

0d66bb13-3666-4b23-bfe9-8dfdc7b6f692-1
00:45:20.568 --> 00:45:22.520
look at it more than just marketing.

782e34be-47b0-4ceb-9f7c-dd5d8458a07e-0
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.118
It has to do with product innovation,
has to do with customer service,

782e34be-47b0-4ceb-9f7c-dd5d8458a07e-1
00:45:27.118 --> 00:45:32.104
has to do with the Permobil Store,
getting our spare parts out to the users

782e34be-47b0-4ceb-9f7c-dd5d8458a07e-2
00:45:32.104 --> 00:45:33.400
as fast as possible.

0702a303-503c-49ff-9f89-d4e2e59d9f9b-0
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.621
So you mentioned that we've done it in
the past,

0702a303-503c-49ff-9f89-d4e2e59d9f9b-1
00:45:35.621 --> 00:45:37.480
but I'm guessing we're also doing it now
as well.

2f3e753e-26d6-4bc1-b6d2-dd407555815c-0
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.086
So I'm going to challenge all the three
of you to give us some concrete examples

2f3e753e-26d6-4bc1-b6d2-dd407555815c-1
00:45:41.086 --> 00:45:44.647
of how we're using brand stickiness and
how we're going to use brand stickiness

2f3e753e-26d6-4bc1-b6d2-dd407555815c-2
00:45:44.647 --> 00:45:45.360
running forward.

2a6f4494-e120-465b-94ce-b98173391203-0
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.400
Yeah, yeah.

19a6789b-c6f3-45b5-ab78-cdcb410f51d1-0
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.674
Well, Chuck already stole some of 
my notes,

19a6789b-c6f3-45b5-ab78-cdcb410f51d1-1
00:45:51.674 --> 00:45:54.280
but one of them is the Permobil Store.

e5a2a76f-626f-4770-b5de-863fa9cc46a4-0
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.430
And first off,
I have to say thanks to everybody in IT,

e5a2a76f-626f-4770-b5de-863fa9cc46a4-1
00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:01.515
marketing, customer experience,
sales operations for getting the 

e5a2a76f-626f-4770-b5de-863fa9cc46a4-2
00:46:01.515 --> 00:46:05.600
Perombil Store up and running in the US with
power parts and SmartDrive.

99f57f88-935e-44ae-9491-56974b52146d-0
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.240
So hats off to Katrin and your entire
team for making that happen.

ff900c42-8699-44a3-bf59-99ad9fa2aa1d-0
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.345
That's away to get sticky with our ATPs
or customers that actually spec out our

ff900c42-8699-44a3-bf59-99ad9fa2aa1d-1
00:46:14.345 --> 00:46:14.760
product.

56b30a5d-2667-484c-8d2b-584ae02a687d-0
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:18.956
They're either going in there and it's so
easy and intuitive and quick,

56b30a5d-2667-484c-8d2b-584ae02a687d-1
00:46:18.956 --> 00:46:22.898
but also be able to get that quote
immediately and be able to use it as a

56b30a5d-2667-484c-8d2b-584ae02a687d-2
00:46:22.898 --> 00:46:26.841
training tool to show their their,
their end user or their therapist what

56b30a5d-2667-484c-8d2b-584ae02a687d-3
00:46:26.841 --> 00:46:28.600
that chair is going to look like.

8cbf205a-465d-4ee5-92e2-07308fdbed9a-0
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:34.640
Also being able to integrate that into a
key customer system.

ca175457-19f8-4938-8b9a-6c6af73eba78-0
00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.383
So we're going to take it to the next
level to where when they're quoting out a

ca175457-19f8-4938-8b9a-6c6af73eba78-1
00:46:38.383 --> 00:46:41.143
product like a Permobil power chair,
when they submit it,

ca175457-19f8-4938-8b9a-6c6af73eba78-2
00:46:41.143 --> 00:46:42.359
it goes into their system.

f85caad6-aa1e-4550-b8ad-8f4e121bbd2f-0
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.851
So they're not having to re-key it in,
make it as easy as possible to do

f85caad6-aa1e-4550-b8ad-8f4e121bbd2f-1
00:46:45.851 --> 00:46:47.000
business with Permobil.

70488ee5-2d40-454e-aaeb-c34e3e45ef41-0
00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.960
OK, thanks so much, Marcus.

f16bbc34-9ad1-414f-a9b6-e920071a1329-0
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:56.317
So similar we have today already areas
either in countries or in products where

f16bbc34-9ad1-414f-a9b6-e920071a1329-1
00:46:56.317 --> 00:46:58.560
we have already brand stickiness.

7629c2fc-1c08-47f2-bb71-a206742bd485-0
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.900
And I mean,
I think one really related to this is our

7629c2fc-1c08-47f2-bb71-a206742bd485-1
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.600
adaptation customization business.

12c238d6-7aa2-4a33-9f68-750fbbeee2f7-0
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.197
When you're out there and you have
special needs,

12c238d6-7aa2-4a33-9f68-750fbbeee2f7-1
00:47:07.197 --> 00:47:11.784
complex needs as a user and you go to
hire the, a provider or to rep,

12c238d6-7aa2-4a33-9f68-750fbbeee2f7-2
00:47:11.784 --> 00:47:16.897
a middle central in, in Scandinavia,
they will immediately think of us as per

12c238d6-7aa2-4a33-9f68-750fbbeee2f7-3
00:47:16.897 --> 00:47:22.140
mobile because we are the ones that are
providing the solutions and technically

12c238d6-7aa2-4a33-9f68-750fbbeee2f7-4
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.319
competition can't.

5ddb8a00-0946-4c41-b8f8-38ced8a67a42-0
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.440
So here you have a very strong stickiness
already today.

c4afb8ca-cbcd-43dc-98a3-216b5993a85d-0
00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.680
Same is for service.

4b99aac1-e48d-4b32-b21a-74a5c02f2da8-0
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:33.369
We sometimes are called even to
competitor chairs because the service

4b99aac1-e48d-4b32-b21a-74a5c02f2da8-1
00:47:33.369 --> 00:47:37.760
that we are able to provide out in the
field is beyond everybody else.

ee0d19a2-7775-48bc-9dc3-151576c18d24-0
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.400
But that's two areas where we already
have the stickiness.

2642eb42-c4f6-4325-91bf-be315bbe781f-0
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.160
And another thing that we have just
launched is the CRM.

143d6f16-0cbf-453e-842f-e88d0628d91d-0
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.585
Sorry, I just
need to mention that it's a great one

7e901fbe-3a80-4202-b362-10ea5ce1f61e-0
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.628
So customer relation management system
where now we are able to connect all kind

7e901fbe-3a80-4202-b362-10ea5ce1f61e-1
00:47:51.628 --> 00:47:53.000
of information and data.

52a95ce6-d1b8-45d2-8f6f-65784b0e951b-0
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.991
And that means that doing business with
us in the future is much,

52a95ce6-d1b8-45d2-8f6f-65784b0e951b-1
00:47:56.991 --> 00:48:01.163
much easier than it is today because
customer support, service, sales rep,

52a95ce6-d1b8-45d2-8f6f-65784b0e951b-2
00:48:01.163 --> 00:48:05.613
everybody that our customers connect have
the same data as a base and can serve

52a95ce6-d1b8-45d2-8f6f-65784b0e951b-3
00:48:05.613 --> 00:48:07.560
them without any knowledge missing.

2d8b2ffb-e201-4aee-accb-f347bfa75ed0-0
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.640
Bruce, can you give us one example from,
from your region?

54981971-5661-4ce7-bc14-63f727f62756-0
00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:11.960
Yeah.

10bfcf66-898d-4e10-8a81-3279fe838121-0
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.902
So in, in APAC,
we've spent a lot of time focusing on end

10bfcf66-898d-4e10-8a81-3279fe838121-1
00:48:14.902 --> 00:48:17.440
user engagement,
really trying to go grass roots.

eb4818c8-c704-4020-bece-8fe39e26c2e9-0
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.136
You might have seen in New Zealand,
we did a Power in the Park program,

eb4818c8-c704-4020-bece-8fe39e26c2e9-1
00:48:22.136 --> 00:48:25.353
we had 1500 users show up to Eden Park,

eb4818c8-c704-4020-bece-8fe39e26c2e9-2
00:48:25.353 --> 00:48:28.800
kind of the national stadium in Auckland
for a large event.

cd8364ef-f52e-4f91-af24-6ff52d8b77f6-0
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.440
We're going to replicate that do that in
Australia for next year.

bd1af2d9-6641-4ae1-90e1-c04512670ab0-0
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.398
And I know the other regions are also
looking at opportunities to have these

bd1af2d9-6641-4ae1-90e1-c04512670ab0-1
00:48:36.398 --> 00:48:40.407
end user programs that aren't Expos,
that aren't shows or about the community

bd1af2d9-6641-4ae1-90e1-c04512670ab0-2
00:48:40.407 --> 00:48:44.160
and building community and that's
building stickiness across the region.

c4d5c332-f06a-43f6-999e-248825968205-0
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:44.640
Definitely.

799a5037-9bc9-40dc-a198-15c07aa352bf-0
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.400
Thanks very much.

a3c69001-caa4-4fb4-bc0a-4a56577646ac-0
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.361
Before we go, actually,
I'm going to come back to you Todd,

a3c69001-caa4-4fb4-bc0a-4a56577646ac-1
00:48:48.361 --> 00:48:51.765
because I'm aware of another another area
that you weren't on which I might have

a3c69001-caa4-4fb4-bc0a-4a56577646ac-2
00:48:51.765 --> 00:48:52.480
cut you short on.

4f571975-2176-4f7b-bf6d-71f35bd5857c-0
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.560
So I apologise for that.

b40ded14-556a-44bf-8901-0ae150e329a7-0
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.120
And that's the Insiders Club.

138ad585-e841-4849-847c-65f05861a8cd-0
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.320
Could you give us a few words about the
Insiders Club?

29645155-7f97-4b02-a8e8-1323118cc3a3-0
00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:02.508
It's a digital and community based way to
engage with their end users through

29645155-7f97-4b02-a8e8-1323118cc3a3-1
00:49:02.508 --> 00:49:03.320
social media.

ed09bbcf-d02a-436a-9d7e-b1117fbdb67b-0
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:07.475
And if you know about Harley Davidson,
one of the strongest brands in the world,

ed09bbcf-d02a-436a-9d7e-b1117fbdb67b-1
00:49:07.475 --> 00:49:10.040
they have a thing called Hog - Harley
Owners Group.

e8b4963d-412e-4d2c-8c4e-ce0635bb3fc0-0
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.058
It's a worldwide club of of people that
own Harley's and they're able to get

e8b4963d-412e-4d2c-8c4e-ce0635bb3fc0-1
00:49:14.058 --> 00:49:18.002
resources, connect with other individuals,
go to different community events across

e8b4963d-412e-4d2c-8c4e-ce0635bb3fc0-2
00:49:18.002 --> 00:49:19.000
the across the globe.

b1a828ff-6009-447e-bd7f-c088a0eabc87-0
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.156
And we want to do we want to replicate
that across the Americas and probably

b1a828ff-6009-447e-bd7f-c088a0eabc87-1
00:49:23.156 --> 00:49:25.640
throughout the world, right?
Yes, absolutely.

ae69801d-c2a4-422f-9c9d-efdd02b14ba6-0
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:26.640
Excellent.

617e2c4d-9c9b-4d02-b103-ca0924701980-0
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.000
Thank you very much for your time.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.800
We're going to move on swiftly as well.

a710a4eb-5cc8-4e82-90b4-1a484066d107-0
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.400
So now we come to our next...

9d8a0eeb-877e-4c59-8524-f0e1eeba0fe9-0
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:33.120
Sorry.

cf2f7998-52e4-4807-bf2f-fbcb25459591-0
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.640
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

08dfba4c-18bd-44d7-b6b4-c167aaf66b0f-0
00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:43.510
So now we come to our next
part of the town hall where we're going

08dfba4c-18bd-44d7-b6b4-c167aaf66b0f-1
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:47.160
to ask you guys to choose what do you
want to hear about next.

ea9c406c-22ba-483f-975d-21cf559b3c21-0
00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:52.512
We have prepared three different
potential topics to discuss and you get

ea9c406c-22ba-483f-975d-21cf559b3c21-1
00:49:52.512 --> 00:49:53.440
to vote on it.

9f228224-8ef2-4930-af14-f73350604234-0
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.230
Please go ahead,
grab your phone or you can log in using

9f228224-8ef2-4930-af14-f73350604234-1
00:49:57.230 --> 00:50:00.200
the Mentimeter URL and code at the top.

d0d9abc8-3a48-4584-9c56-aeb8d8a4f0c8-0
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.160
We're going to,
there's three options there.

b8155403-5beb-45ae-9afd-fe5cda9ef47e-0
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.000
One is about Speed Control Dial and the
lessons learnt from that product recall

b8e76cae-4df1-46b1-bc94-8d17682cd0ed-0
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.060
we just did recently, market correction. 
Talking about how we're using

b8e76cae-4df1-46b1-bc94-8d17682cd0ed-1
00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.640
the data we're getting from Permobil
Connect and the power chairs.

1ec4535e-ed4e-4e40-a1cd-fba6ed7a960f-0
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.440
And the third one is about the future of
Permobil and AI.

842af073-87ca-48d1-851c-66ad9535fc96-0
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.440
It's very hotly contested.

2679de7f-ab97-4333-8236-278653429e9f-0
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:24.040
I know some GM members have got some
money writing on which one they think is

2679de7f-ab97-4333-8236-278653429e9f-1
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:24.640
going to win.

997d17a8-69f6-4fef-b9d4-aac794a83605-0
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.240
Someone's going to be poorer.

355763ba-34d8-4977-8115-707ae5a9988f-0
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.360
Someone's going to be richer.

df60bfbe-0855-40dc-9238-94efdfb97907-0
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.280
We're going to leave this open for a
little bit longer.

5e48432c-3600-4c36-a530-5fbfba1330ba-0
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.520
Let's see how the results are going.

4c914ab2-9832-4fcb-a829-b0a7470dc3ee-0
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.600
I thought we would see the live results.

cce0f08c-94df-479d-8055-31e2b3274470-0
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:47.920
Yeah, I'm.

c4841c0c-5344-4530-b933-3e94afab616a-0
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.440
I'm looking at the tech desk.

eea69f6c-23a1-4bea-b203-5739f52341bf-0
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:55.760
There we go.

b61b3b44-cefb-446b-97ba-b249a2eee591-0
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:07.090
I think the relevant people should get
themselves ready.

b7f7ece4-c8bb-47d9-a2c1-0862558f1a3a-0
00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:14.201
OK,
So it's Charlotta and Katrin to talk

b7f7ece4-c8bb-47d9-a2c1-0862558f1a3a-1
00:51:14.201 --> 00:51:16.690
about the future of Perombil and AI.

25bdde88-3eda-4ded-bc7b-02f76db098cd-0
00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.250
I'm going to,
I'm going to call it now.

3ce772fe-58e8-4f92-988b-b66e3fc18a70-0
00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.290
I don't think Speed Control Dial is going
to catch up.

995656a0-476b-4d08-878a-ec70052c2fde-0
00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:25.930
Thank you very much.

633dd0fd-9c71-45cb-b6db-ad57297d0016-0
00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.320
Yes, thank you a lot for voting.

dee7c09e-1a2d-46a6-84b0-dc4e053c776e-0
00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.960
And we had it riding and I actually bet
it against myself.

4be6effc-aaf8-43e0-9b75-c255fe616341-0
00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.320
So let's see how this goes.

be63f658-85de-4cea-af3e-067c7d5ac6e0-0
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.640
Do you want to stand or do you want to take
a seat, as you prefer? Stand.

231e541f-9e7f-4b0b-89fd-d3396e0990fc-0
00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.040
Yeah, we stand.

a0613a9c-18f0-4349-b495-4f43ba89edcd-0
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:46.120
I have a lot of note cards for this,
so this one's going to come to you.

d6118e4a-9acb-4b2d-be92-99c9810b5a86-0
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:50.920
So the new strategy talks about an AI
core and AI is an accelerator.

59db8340-cffd-4793-9537-1caafedd4425-0
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.880
How is that different to how we're
working with AI at the moment?

e63fa08b-304a-4e27-8b1d-a48f7ca7be84-0
00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.980
I think one of the key differences that
today we are using AI a lot, right,

e63fa08b-304a-4e27-8b1d-a48f7ca7be84-1
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.880
But we are using platforms that the other
has developed from us.

f72c24b5-a52d-4943-af9a-0044123750a5-0
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.640
We have the Sana, we have the Co-pilot,
etcetera.

00fadd87-2ae2-4fef-a64e-0527d526e4d5-0
00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:13.345
One of the key things that we are
committing to right now is to build our

00fadd87-2ae2-4fef-a64e-0527d526e4d5-1
00:52:13.345 --> 00:52:16.120
own AI engine and then our own AI core.

5b16f81e-c7c6-4881-86b2-738b00e72f7d-0
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.520
So that's a big difference.

32ab42d1-47e5-48f8-b939-3e87dfce54df-0
00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.280
Now we like customize at Permobil.

599f75cf-0c8f-4bd5-966e-6549a3e4ba7a-0
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.040
We have a whole division here producing
amazing bits of work.

6ea85a85-8055-4e13-a3c1-3ab8b9404775-0
00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:28.160
We've even plugged out CAISA AI and the
search tool into the customization.

39fb554d-a25d-4471-8c02-88f788a76a10-0
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:33.520
So why not use the ready made 
AI platforms that are out there?

27beb953-615e-41e5-a2a4-bef76cef5c44-0
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.680
That would surely would be the fastest
way to get about it.

4f2d7511-66ac-4b72-946b-9e1c1ab05b25-0
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.320
Talking about pace of acceleration,
why not just buy in what's there?

ea82c222-71bb-4c74-84c0-b05972f8c541-0
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.120
Yeah, we could do that.

5544f44f-c0a7-47af-8b96-f74c3777fc6f-0
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.320
Is this working?

c1b9fe0a-fe1b-4fa0-a220-bde08b086590-0
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:42.880
Is this switched on?

306a2be7-6555-49c4-8532-9f73309516a4-0
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:43.080
No.

d448eb92-6e30-43e1-97b5-946b9efaf0d7-0
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:47.920
OK, very good.

942a03db-5402-4e49-9f0d-7b7693c61015-0
00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:48.520
Thank you.

0050b5fe-6de5-4b8f-b39c-fc859c682f62-0
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:49.920
I only work with IT.

f8259d25-3d5a-40aa-8224-57df8b9c50a8-0
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.800
So are you going to say this is a
comms issue?

844f268d-24b2-46ec-bcb2-e2c4e30de660-0
00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.080
You know you don't have an engineer,
right?

b2a765e3-0be1-4690-84ae-e2a90119d19b-0
00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:57.920
Yeah.

2b66956f-0da2-4562-99b3-880783d3dad3-0
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.880
Anyway, sorry, yes.

6b9a2272-9f27-451b-b9bc-eb582dae0f5e-0
00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.461
So a resource in my team said that if we
can buy the solution,

6b9a2272-9f27-451b-b9bc-eb582dae0f5e-1
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:09.280
someone else can as well.

cb8a532a-895f-43b0-9a25-630d42b83f00-0
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.720
And then we're not unique.

b52c24d7-b2fe-4140-ba70-c45187935fcb-0
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:15.355
So if we want to be different,
then let's build our own AI core and

b52c24d7-b2fe-4140-ba70-c45187935fcb-1
00:53:15.355 --> 00:53:17.360
Chuck call it the Mother Brain.

e5f16ce6-0f93-4c8e-b535-00b7c3c56844-0
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:18.920
Yes.

d0e5dbd0-be20-4ed7-8744-a49f36846081-0
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:24.440
And if we do this ourselves, we can,
we can be a bit flexible in modeling.

866c9c5d-9e00-449d-b083-51dfb9cc3fb5-0
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.465
We need to be unique and we can,
in some cases we can,

866c9c5d-9e00-449d-b083-51dfb9cc3fb5-1
00:53:27.465 --> 00:53:31.040
we can use a standard model and adapt
it to to what we need.

7900f5ee-3abd-44bc-b3e8-666dec027069-0
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.827
And in other areas where we be need to be
unique,

7900f5ee-3abd-44bc-b3e8-666dec027069-1
00:53:34.827 --> 00:53:40.160
we need to build our own Permobil model
and train it on our CAD data, etc.

a8c34ab9-2241-4f24-bcdd-c34329348a8c-0
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:45.979
And then if we, if we train this model,
we can use multiple models and be

a8c34ab9-2241-4f24-bcdd-c34329348a8c-1
00:53:45.979 --> 00:53:49.320
flexible and,
and use the best in both worlds.

d553d9ec-786c-41ae-b79c-d79446c044b2-0
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.710
And then this backbone,
this mother brain that we then build,

d553d9ec-786c-41ae-b79c-d79446c044b2-1
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:56.960
we can build all our AI solutions on top
of that.

4fe46cd9-5ffa-4d80-ab4d-242db8be87a3-0
00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.988
And I mean, the,
the AI areas and the solutions we have so

4fe46cd9-5ffa-4d80-ab4d-242db8be87a3-1
00:54:00.988 --> 00:54:04.320
far, they're useful,
but they're built in isolation.

2c3208b3-7360-49b4-b4a5-e7a8c75b75d3-0
00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.560
OK, thank you very much.

590047ec-1447-4d0e-b4c9-da077b4a9a50-0
00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.473
Now,
can you give us some some use case

590047ec-1447-4d0e-b4c9-da077b4a9a50-1
00:54:09.473 --> 00:54:13.240
examples how we were going to be able to
use this AI core?

824d2b1b-8d53-4760-8caf-42ae99343b3f-0
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.570
Well, I had a great example,
but Chuck just used that when he went

824d2b1b-8d53-4760-8caf-42ae99343b3f-1
00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:18.640
through the strategy.

2b15caf4-d64d-4bd9-a965-14ff6c529897-0
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:24.168
But if we then take, if we then take that,
and if we have that suggestion that CAD

2b15caf4-d64d-4bd9-a965-14ff6c529897-1
00:54:24.168 --> 00:54:29.429
drawings can also be used and improved
and we can test it digitally and we can

2b15caf4-d64d-4bd9-a965-14ff6c529897-2
00:54:29.429 --> 00:54:32.760
even hopefully have it being prototyped
directly.

54dd6e88-4521-4d5c-8379-c0b2d28b19d7-0
00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.796
And that type of quickness that can kind
of acceleration will really help us with

54dd6e88-4521-4d5c-8379-c0b2d28b19d7-1
00:54:37.796 --> 00:54:39.120
our pace of innovation.

d1f0279a-7153-4a6c-b598-2cc1ce523c94-0
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:40.840
Yeah.

9d676b71-23ef-46ad-8e5d-8eacfb5e7a20-0
00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:46.586
And an easier example is perhaps to just
apply computer vision in our assembly

9d676b71-23ef-46ad-8e5d-8eacfb5e7a20-1
00:54:46.586 --> 00:54:52.551
line to have an extra set of eyes in on
each station so that we can easily detect

9d676b71-23ef-46ad-8e5d-8eacfb5e7a20-2
00:54:52.551 --> 00:54:58.080
if there's a defect made or yeah,
we can reduce rework and improve quality.

f4143377-64a7-4af3-b40e-2c6afb7dbabc-0
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.689
So how quickly do you think you'll be
able to see this kind of tricking down

f4143377-64a7-4af3-b40e-2c6afb7dbabc-1
00:55:02.689 --> 00:55:05.080
and working in our, you know,
everyday work?

5626ae04-71a6-44ec-ae1b-1103c39aef4f-0
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.680
I heard something about not planning time
plans so forth.

b24d78fb-90f8-4bf9-9fc2-258ef273c38c-0
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.619
But I mean,
our initial idea is that we start with

b24d78fb-90f8-4bf9-9fc2-258ef273c38c-1
00:55:12.619 --> 00:55:16.738
one area or one team and then we learn
from that experience and then we expand

b24d78fb-90f8-4bf9-9fc2-258ef273c38c-2
00:55:16.738 --> 00:55:18.720
to the next area and to the next team.

75f992c2-e836-436a-8492-9ccaf79de88f-0
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:23.195
So you're opening yourself up to which is,
which will be the first area,

75f992c2-e836-436a-8492-9ccaf79de88f-1
00:55:23.195 --> 00:55:25.000
which is a good question, right?

1beb3b8c-ae82-4fd1-860f-4ab150f9861b-0
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.400
So we just heard the new strategy and it
is new as well for GM.

043cff6a-2eb6-4873-84e1-8ccc14a01889-0
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.457
So let's start,
let's do the prioritization and we will

043cff6a-2eb6-4873-84e1-8ccc14a01889-1
00:55:32.457 --> 00:55:33.440
come back to that.

22416605-3c13-43ef-b854-d8544faa5853-0
00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.280
But again, we are not starting from zero.

73e328ff-394d-4403-9a7a-9d469a59df3c-0
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.560
We're already doing things in AI.

4e503862-f348-423a-8641-682a94875994-0
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:45.240
But I don't think that the greatest ideas
will come only from the strategy.

ac9f22c7-6cc9-4d72-b120-65a47f920c11-0
00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:50.550
I think that when you all give input on
how you can truly change the way you're

ac9f22c7-6cc9-4d72-b120-65a47f920c11-1
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.802
working,
that's when we will find the real great

ac9f22c7-6cc9-4d72-b120-65a47f920c11-2
00:55:53.802 --> 00:55:54.400
examples.

3f6a7530-6d78-4df8-b47f-342addb22b7f-0
00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:55.600
OK.

03446ed4-c40d-4cf5-a2d4-6189aa35d698-0
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:56.720
Thank you very much.

23db55e1-915e-4086-9c02-f73ac97af133-0
00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.880
We're going to move swiftly on.

cf66a236-7207-4b04-b02a-6740afe44e4c-0
00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:01.600
We're going to invite the rest of the GM
to come back up or to come back on the

cf66a236-7207-4b04-b02a-6740afe44e4c-1
00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:01.880
stage.

10493555-1689-41d4-97a9-23ace636a66c-0
00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.647
Yeah,
so invite people back on stage and those

10493555-1689-41d4-97a9-23ace636a66c-1
00:56:05.647 --> 00:56:11.911
who you can stay Charlotta, you can stay and
then those who haven't been on yet and

10493555-1689-41d4-97a9-23ace636a66c-2
00:56:11.911 --> 00:56:15.480
we're going to do our questions and
answers.

4585fbe4-406a-4fdd-bb12-ac57658b7df5-0
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.720
Let's see what's been coming through
going to come forward.

15adce96-994b-4a4c-86c8-500e2bb8a808-0
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.600
I'll sitting around the corner.

abafaf84-e5ea-4a68-bfe6-0f771038bc42-0
00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.680
I like that here.

4519a0da-c3fc-4e14-865b-23c59a93f40d-0
00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.400
OK,
here's here's an easy quick one for you

4519a0da-c3fc-4e14-865b-23c59a93f40d-1
00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:32.800
guys.

d01e9793-b74d-41f0-8f3c-d85be92be7cc-0
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.200
Are there any of you take this maybe
Chuck you, you take this one.

265e5e6f-79c4-4dbe-ad8d-b43bb719783a-0
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.320
Are you moving away from the strategic
house?

af9cc055-04c1-4177-abbd-95836cf84db2-0
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:40.960
Yes.

61d20642-7db2-49c6-87c8-53881d89e969-0
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.400
OK, next question.

d5e1275a-7a59-4d2b-950e-3e927de3ca37-0
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.720
Not that it's wrong necessarily, right?

fdc22ea9-9a2b-4882-9032-9ac3fd43c305-0
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.835
A lot of those principles have have
brought us here and we'll continue with

fdc22ea9-9a2b-4882-9032-9ac3fd43c305-1
00:56:50.835 --> 00:56:51.160
right.

68b97ce3-d942-40c8-9cea-5fc5ed0382e1-0
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.816
But this is, yeah, this is a new,
a new fresh take on our strategy moving

68b97ce3-d942-40c8-9cea-5fc5ed0382e1-1
00:56:55.816 --> 00:56:56.320
forward.

2ec3db0e-405f-4c4d-ba6b-b5ac3202d686-0
00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.080
Here's an interesting one.

d09d2da5-49ce-4787-b6b5-0bcb066787c0-0
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.987
So how can Permobil maintain it's
technological advantage globally and in

d09d2da5-49ce-4787-b6b5-0bcb066787c0-1
00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:09.159
the US if to have this person's knowledge,
if to my knowledge we don't have a

d09d2da5-49ce-4787-b6b5-0bcb066787c0-2
00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:14.331
dedicated data science or data mining
department to utilise AI manufacturing?

d09d2da5-49ce-4787-b6b5-0bcb066787c0-3
00:57:14.331 --> 00:57:16.520
Charlotta looks ready for that.

ac8578da-3a97-42de-95b0-23c51f40d45e-0
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.491
Well,
I think that's one of the things that we

ac8578da-3a97-42de-95b0-23c51f40d45e-1
00:57:19.491 --> 00:57:23.974
are saying in this strategy that we do
need. And we do need to invest in the

ac8578da-3a97-42de-95b0-23c51f40d45e-2
00:57:23.974 --> 00:57:24.800
manufacturing.

2e87a546-d91b-4efe-a693-7a5e890551fb-0
00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:30.317
And I think that we're going to need data
mining and data science in many different

2e87a546-d91b-4efe-a693-7a5e890551fb-1
00:57:30.317 --> 00:57:32.160
areas, not just manufacturing.

c4c55559-e1eb-4ca3-a3cd-ec79fdbf0cec-0
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.960
So I agree, we need it.

c7fea847-1b7b-49e0-8b9a-55f7a88f8009-0
00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:36.800
OK.

4ac11629-05aa-48fa-a498-183abc4b76eb-0
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:42.720
With all of these major internal changes,
how do we ensure that we maintain our

4ac11629-05aa-48fa-a498-183abc4b76eb-1
00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.000
culture and keep our focus on the users?

2ae467f4-244f-462d-89d7-b8cb3ed9bae2-0
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.171
Emma,
you've not had a chance to say anything yet.

cdddad6f-588b-411a-93fb-d6b737be8abb-0
00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:48.920
Thank you.

e9dac3c8-aa44-42d3-bc71-fbd7481372c3-0
00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:49.720
Yeah.

e9c13283-f293-4914-a994-53b81437568f-0
00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:53.591
First of all,
I think we all can acknowledge that this

e9c13283-f293-4914-a994-53b81437568f-1
00:57:53.591 --> 00:57:58.800
is a great company with a lot of
passionate people that are user focused.

6f24af00-a397-4d33-91ed-7c6bc553b564-0
00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:04.445
So we have talked a lot about how do we
ensure that we bring that on the journey

6f24af00-a397-4d33-91ed-7c6bc553b564-1
00:58:04.445 --> 00:58:05.840
that we are heading.

70ec8713-6409-4870-a0fc-e5fe4d88b1f7-0
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.396
Building on that,
we also realise when we listen to the new

70ec8713-6409-4870-a0fc-e5fe4d88b1f7-1
00:58:12.396 --> 00:58:19.141
strategy that there are changes coming
and we are all needed to bring this

70ec8713-6409-4870-a0fc-e5fe4d88b1f7-2
00:58:19.141 --> 00:58:20.759
change to reality.

c596e46c-d352-4da3-a746-9e353d1341f0-0
00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.954
We all need to lean into what Agile means,


c596e46c-d352-4da3-a746-9e353d1341f0-1
00:58:24.954 --> 00:58:28.760
Independently if we work with product 
development or something else.

cdb282b6-4cbd-4039-9430-27237204321a-0
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.440
So there will be definitely new element
to what this culture mean.

03895c6c-e91f-4236-b42d-9a8ad5ec3411-0
00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:40.264
The one thing I really love about this
strategy, and that culture is part of it,

03895c6c-e91f-4236-b42d-9a8ad5ec3411-1
00:58:40.264 --> 00:58:46.598
but that it also talks about how we will
empower teams and how we will collaborate

03895c6c-e91f-4236-b42d-9a8ad5ec3411-2
00:58:46.598 --> 00:58:52.474
in the future working much more cross
functional because that will be one of

03895c6c-e91f-4236-b42d-9a8ad5ec3411-3
00:58:52.474 --> 00:58:55.680
the key things if we are going to succeed.

1b311da3-a4fa-4764-9413-76c30bc71017-0
00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.040
OK, thank you, Emma.

0250715e-6669-48ca-a4f8-267b747f8e52-0
00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.548
So my feed is telling me that we've had a

0250715e-6669-48ca-a4f8-267b747f8e52-1
00:59:00.548 --> 00:59:03.360
lot of questions about AI and how we're
going to use it.

6686a181-0e8b-41d6-ab64-c659396943c8-0
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.120
So I'm going to just pick a couple of
those.

c8903420-6e52-4fb7-9986-8e0cef17836f-0
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.737
Perhaps the most concrete of those,
which perhaps hasn't been addressed in

c8903420-6e52-4fb7-9986-8e0cef17836f-1
00:59:10.737 --> 00:59:14.979
the previous discussion we just had is
how much are we planning to invest in AI

c8903420-6e52-4fb7-9986-8e0cef17836f-2
00:59:14.979 --> 00:59:16.040
in the next 5 years?

f3bc35fa-89c9-4a48-9636-5c92cc87a565-0
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.440
Halota, you're,
you're the one with the wallet.

11dd43e2-b64c-467e-9461-03faa55db09d-0
00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.280
People tell me.

fbd98933-76f6-4a7f-86a1-bcfe5b268bbc-0
00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.640
I think that that's the discussions that
we're having right now.

c150c779-c870-4419-a403-48bc9a792623-0
00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.521
So first of all,
we need to understand what are all the

c150c779-c870-4419-a403-48bc9a792623-1
00:59:26.521 --> 00:59:29.000
things that we want to do and how do we
fund them.

e1e1e082-edf2-4cce-8c64-f03992a56911-0
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.560
So I have to come back on that.

53d387a8-f183-4d22-9e98-48279cb8a09b-0
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.006
But yes,
many of these things that we are talking

53d387a8-f183-4d22-9e98-48279cb8a09b-1
00:59:34.006 --> 00:59:35.920
about will require investments.

cb26d721-e906-4390-a84e-bf0891db2c4b-0
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.264
And that means that we are not only
talking about adding things,

cb26d721-e906-4390-a84e-bf0891db2c4b-1
00:59:40.264 --> 00:59:44.536
that also means that we need to
prioritize on the things that we are

cb26d721-e906-4390-a84e-bf0891db2c4b-2
00:59:44.536 --> 00:59:45.280
doing today.

f701c9ab-c84f-4468-98d6-c0611673bb1b-0
00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:48.120
But an exact amount I will not give you.

7948f4b5-7cc0-4f29-83c8-90a2b63632c2-0
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.560
I'll come back on that.

6bc8852e-c4d4-4c2a-93a4-f807537225c2-0
00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:50.600
That's fair enough.

a042c2d0-3b0e-4e93-9793-badf76026094-0
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.520
That's fair.

e139ba61-67f6-45a3-82bf-b1218af1bc1d-0
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:51.640
Yeah.

7c33486f-3132-407a-8e4b-b8237f9ae8bf-0
00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:55.203
So I think we're going to take two more
questions because I'm just also conscious

7c33486f-3132-407a-8e4b-b8237f9ae8bf-1
00:59:55.203 --> 00:59:55.520
of time.

4c491693-7091-40ba-ab8f-179101fe7051-0
00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.421
So this question is,
do we see a need to expand our product

4c491693-7091-40ba-ab8f-179101fe7051-1
01:00:00.421 --> 01:00:03.400
portfolio further or access to new
markets?

d3fae00e-33ea-431f-b6e1-287a3638d318-0
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.200
If so, where do we see big potentials?

49985149-66d2-4f0c-a472-797f30b0e049-0
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.478
So Todd,
do you want to take that one or or does

49985149-66d2-4f0c-a472-797f30b0e049-1
01:00:10.478 --> 01:00:12.560
anyone know help him out?

991b87e9-4c07-4182-b685-def44e24967e-0
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.800
The answer is yes, obviously.

1593960a-bb64-4cda-b50c-3102e95b8b24-0
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.720
Can we get his mic?

8d506f45-2da2-48bc-98fd-3036bfb5c496-0
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.360
Just take your own.

8796279b-017b-4476-92a6-c1206807a0ae-0
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.360
Maybe take the handheld.

61134612-1978-49e6-900d-b1961a90c4c6-0
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.629
The, the answer is yes,
we need to expand markets, but we we look,

61134612-1978-49e6-900d-b1961a90c4c6-1
01:00:24.629 --> 01:00:27.683
we're looking at areas outside of the
complex rehab space,

61134612-1978-49e6-900d-b1961a90c4c6-2
01:00:27.683 --> 01:00:31.359
but also within the complex rehab space
where we have the white spots.

630013c5-2f24-4454-9ac7-68eba8e8b4d2-0
01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.222
That's one area that I know the product
development team is working on as well as

630013c5-2f24-4454-9ac7-68eba8e8b4d2-1
01:00:35.222 --> 01:00:35.560
M&amp;A.

ab71e527-1478-4229-ac27-f59968e7d5f9-0
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:40.843
So the answer is we'll always be looking
at areas adjacent to our industry and

ab71e527-1478-4229-ac27-f59968e7d5f9-1
01:00:40.843 --> 01:00:42.080
within our industry.

46010d10-fa3b-4af5-92f1-4a1b106debee-0
01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:42.760
OK.

0eaffa22-56e9-490c-9d13-d296a9d561a3-0
01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.680
And who wants to take the question about
perhaps new markets?

84336a28-37ce-4a81-a5b1-5081e270dba3-0
01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.640
Bruce looks give it to Bruce.

670ca2f1-4f70-49a9-9739-06779fbb7478-0
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.720
Bruce has got a big region coming from APAC.

7eb50426-85c0-4e45-938b-168310756923-0
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.680
We have most of the world's population in
APEC.

092b612d-83dd-455c-a09c-b1f38ba11501-0
01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.720
A lot of those markets are very
underserved for end users.

a35d8dbd-ee42-452c-b6c7-8a99c28bd2ed-0
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.160
There is a big need for us to address
some of those key markets.

37b524c0-6199-4795-9a1b-6fc565d2c42d-0
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.480
Not looking at them as a whole.

15501172-dac0-456b-a48f-649d451d5c9d-0
01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.940
It would be very difficult to do say all
of India at once,

15501172-dac0-456b-a48f-649d451d5c9d-1
01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:14.638
but looking potentially at the city play,
looking at specific cities where we can

15501172-dac0-456b-a48f-649d451d5c9d-2
01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:15.040
access.

7331ca28-78f1-4fc6-a298-0c4a6540e7cb-0
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.168
But this is going to have to be
calculated because there's so many things

7331ca28-78f1-4fc6-a298-0c4a6540e7cb-1
01:01:18.168 --> 01:01:18.760
we have to do.

024d7c63-ad96-4d8d-8bfe-2844411e1654-0
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.911
We have to manage our resources and we
have to deploy where it makes the most

024d7c63-ad96-4d8d-8bfe-2844411e1654-1
01:01:22.911 --> 01:01:23.200
sense.

b93d33b4-6f63-45f0-be52-08762340149b-0
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.586
But definitely there's there's
opportunity with an ageing population and

b93d33b4-6f63-45f0-be52-08762340149b-1
01:01:26.586 --> 01:01:28.720
more people with disabilities in those
areas.

5817dc3c-d227-419d-b203-0ef378b9cbcc-0
01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.360
OK, thank you very much, Bruce.

f1395838-8e29-486a-a559-a2c327adc630-0
01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.840
We've got lots of interesting questions
coming in.

c89fd466-f3f3-41fc-9c21-ad8732419a68-0
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.040
I did see my colleagues who are going to
moderate them just send me a few.

61476d60-e8e7-4b64-bd97-5f39b359af9c-0
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.360
But they just keep sending me.

b38af89c-269d-4b89-a951-0a148d020967-0
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.480
They've got so many good ones.

ac75fd2f-aa9d-4003-b0ad-346282414b17-0
01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.760
I think what we'll do is we will take
these questions to you guys.

e62c047a-f35f-4a5d-8a4b-338fa494fa40-0
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.928
We will put together some answers and
then we'll share them with everyone later

e62c047a-f35f-4a5d-8a4b-338fa494fa40-1
01:01:44.928 --> 01:01:45.040
on.

7b4c0bf7-2739-4f5a-a696-365b4d183e4f-0
01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.737
There's questions about ISO requirements,
robotics, when it comes to manufacturing,

7b4c0bf7-2739-4f5a-a696-365b4d183e4f-1
01:01:49.737 --> 01:01:52.682
where we will,
where will we be in 10 years time and so

7b4c0bf7-2739-4f5a-a696-365b4d183e4f-2
01:01:52.682 --> 01:01:52.840
on.

4c5f9c80-6135-4b79-a3fa-68cfd9440d35-0
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.006
I think the last question I think is
perhaps the most concrete or perhaps not

4c5f9c80-6135-4b79-a3fa-68cfd9440d35-1
01:01:57.006 --> 01:01:59.398
concrete,
but it's something that everybody can

4c5f9c80-6135-4b79-a3fa-68cfd9440d35-2
01:01:59.398 --> 01:02:02.040
relate to and that's this one's going to
be for you.

4170d768-d4c4-4e18-8072-1d932951307d-0
01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.440
Chuck.

5201c664-9f02-48e7-9c80-da6a66e946ed-0
01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.977
I see you've avoided the Q&amp;A 
so far and that is when can we as

5201c664-9f02-48e7-9c80-da6a66e946ed-1
01:02:06.977 --> 01:02:08.480
employees start or what?

42c27dec-1cf3-4306-ba63-526353b90df3-0
01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.994
Sorry,
what can we as employees start doing

42c27dec-1cf3-4306-ba63-526353b90df3-1
01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:11.680
differently?

466575b0-e61a-4a93-b53e-c9f58dc41990-0
01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.880
Thank you for that question!

858903f5-c848-41f3-ae54-c57cf77fde29-0
01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.000
Yes, I mean I mentioned it a little bit.

f48d4581-5d7c-4a51-a973-2b581ff95c78-0
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.360
I think there are several things.

c692aa65-cb02-43b7-af9f-9973dfecd64b-0
01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.588
One,
I want to empower all of you to focus on

c692aa65-cb02-43b7-af9f-9973dfecd64b-1
01:02:22.588 --> 01:02:29.200
identifying and eliminating non value add
activities throughout the organization.

e55513b2-f564-4bb9-aed2-54995aa60df6-0
01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.320
We have a lot and that's how we
create space to do new things, right?

3936c870-40a2-41c3-a8c1-a045e155aaf8-0
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.400
So and we don't have we don't even know
what all those things are, right.

554dd0c8-73e6-461f-a779-541e864315aa-0
01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.920
So it has to come from within the
organization.

67e1d649-d529-4e9b-a4e9-6a2561f978dd-0
01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.235
And that means being curious,
but also taking the initiative to say,

67e1d649-d529-4e9b-a4e9-6a2561f978dd-1
01:02:47.235 --> 01:02:51.011
hey, team,
I don't think this is actually adding any

67e1d649-d529-4e9b-a4e9-6a2561f978dd-2
01:02:51.011 --> 01:02:54.360
value to our products for our end users,
right?

f63a2b9f-d4bd-4cde-81e4-9d1278c6d64f-0
01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.040
And taking the initiative to do that.

1b4379f6-977c-4bd7-ab7d-c3f586603117-0
01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.080
That's number one.

b68302f7-514f-4d7e-b11a-7ebf6a47de2c-0
01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:02.456
I think Emma mentioned the other one and
and Catharina,

b68302f7-514f-4d7e-b11a-7ebf6a47de2c-1
01:03:02.456 --> 01:03:05.240
Maybe two others....

41c5f5fb-8a55-422b-966e-6158d1d5e1c2-0
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.000
You got to be curious, right?

c302b046-a95d-4f8b-a0c6-674b81e10b04-0
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.600
So please get curious about some of the
things that you're hearing about.

cc8f5a51-714a-4913-a823-9a07a2ca19a7-0
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.160
I know a lot of folks are asking AI,
what the heck does this mean, right?

0d769109-e743-4898-b6f3-e2fe9559d7c9-0
01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:14.640
Good.

6deb7a80-d509-41ef-a3c7-4f24f64e292b-0
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.520
Please get curious about what we're
talking about.

de4aa0bf-caba-422a-93ec-8d3594727425-0
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.360
We shouldn't be the experts.

af1162a6-0dee-464a-8e10-0b835ecdd4f9-0
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.120
Again,
it should be the people that are the

af1162a6-0dee-464a-8e10-0b835ecdd4f9-1
01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.000
experts on the topics.

077942ca-67d8-40cc-8ef4-4c9c94251eaf-0
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:28.120
And then this goes to all of the managers
out there and the line managers.

ef48ee3c-dcb0-43a2-b148-a57b3b16959e-0
01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.120
Please empower your people,
empower your people, right?

287d5390-5dea-46f9-b27c-3bf4a809abe5-0
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.160
And that means trust them to do the right
thing.

e799e5e1-5f55-4e19-9541-b51fc8c2dde3-0
01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.640
And are we all going to get everything
right all the time?

414beeca-0096-48a9-a24f-ece2b9884fb2-0
01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.640
Of course not, right.

7de193ac-4243-4993-8e9a-3550fc5a370c-0
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.040
We will all make mistakes.

997b4a66-2633-478a-aa45-5617c6eed324-0
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.080
But we have to trust and empower our
people.

f7fa2315-213c-48fa-8759-6bb88d9d89a5-0
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.480
And that by itself creates a big morale
boost and eliminates a lot of waste.

9d61dd95-b7a6-4bf9-9020-17d0384eaa23-0
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.120
OK, thank you very much.

13899522-1b85-4ce8-9bcb-856563f78e85-0
01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.120
And it feels like, at least for me,
the this hour has flown by.

c8047e47-da6f-4764-87f3-e458c3b1ea8a-0
01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.245
We've kind of moved it a bit of a
breakneck speed to try and squeeze

c8047e47-da6f-4764-87f3-e458c3b1ea8a-1
01:04:00.245 --> 01:04:00.880
everything in.

7c74518e-0eff-4012-969c-1242cfab99f1-0
01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.280
Thank you, everyone, for participating.

2e67ab5d-2677-4db0-90f1-76ab5fba764c-0
01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.601
Before we wrap up,
do you want to have any closing words for

2e67ab5d-2677-4db0-90f1-76ab5fba764c-1
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:07.080
us, Chuck?

d7a86b15-f576-4718-a11f-8661b1fabf04-0
01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:08.400
Yeah.

dd9fceae-d51f-49ab-a327-7f4201243404-0
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.840
I just want to say, you know,
there's a lot of information, right?

89a69d07-11e2-413e-aa17-24e03a4af3d1-0
01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.960
And there's a lot more information 
behind it.

567487e3-5dc1-4529-8574-a22522e41714-0
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.585
So as a next step,
we have a lot of continued communication

567487e3-5dc1-4529-8574-a22522e41714-1
01:04:18.585 --> 01:04:21.120
on this that you'll see online and
elsewhere.

f03fa30f-45c7-4fe8-bd50-c85df6bbed7e-0
01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.804
I think even starting here in the next
few days, we'll publish a sort of a,

f03fa30f-45c7-4fe8-bd50-c85df6bbed7e-1
01:04:26.804 --> 01:04:30.270
a narrative,
a memo that we'll walk through again,
